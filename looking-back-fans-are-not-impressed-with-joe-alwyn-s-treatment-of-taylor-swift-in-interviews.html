But was this because he didn't have anything nice to say or was he just unsure about how to deal with the spotlight? Let's find out.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-39-s-relationship-was-always-a-source-of-interest>Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn's Relationship Was Always A Source Of Interest</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-paparazzi-photo.jpg><p>As former flames of Taylor can attest, being in a relationship with her guarantees fan interest to the point of obsession. After <a href=#>Joe and Taylor met</a>, reportedly at the 2016 Met Gala, and rumors about the two dating began circulating, Joe received a level of interest in the media that he had likely never expected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon, his every move became a source of pictures, and rumors about his private life with Taylor were all over the internet. As the relationship continued, he inspired over 20 of Taylor's songs and the couple <a href=#>even won a Grammy for </a><a href=#>Folklore</a>.</p><p>Fan interest never peaked. After the relationship became long-term, instead of trying to figure out how long Taylor and Joe would last, fans started wondering when marriage was going to happen and <a href=#>why they were still not engaged</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Joe Alwyn And Taylor Swift Bought A Massive Mansion Before Splitting Up: Where Does Joe Live Now?</a></span></p><p>Besides the interest in the relationship, there were also private concerns, including Taylor's reported worry that the publicity she garnered was going to <a href=#>ruin her relationship with Joe</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I think that in knowing him and being in the relationship I am in now, I have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on in tabloids,” she said in 2020.</p><h2 id=joe-and-taylor-each-mentioned-each-other-in-interviews>Joe And Taylor Each Mentioned Each Other In Interviews</h2><p>Naturally, Joe and Taylor were asked about their relationship in interviews, and they had to discuss it regardless of their feelings about privacy. In Miss Americana, Taylor Swift's documentary, she discussed the relationship, saying, "I was happy. But I wasn't happy with how I was trained to be happy. It was happiness without anyone else's input. We were just happy."</p><p>She also talked about <a href=#>what brought her and Joe together</a>.</p><p>“Joe and I really love sad songs. We've always bonded over music.”</p><p>She explained that she was both surprised and expecting to bond with Joe over music because their tastes were so similar.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Joe Alwyn Have The Lowest Net Worth Of All Taylor Swift's Boyfriends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I say it was a surprise that we started writing together, but in a way, it wasn't because we have always bonded over music and had the same musical tastes. And he's always the person who's showing me songs by artists and then they become my favorite songs or whatever. But yeah, ‘Champagne Problems,’ that was one of my favorite bridges to write. I really love a bridge where you tell the full story in the bridge, like, you really shift gears in that bridge,” she said.</p><p>For his part, Joe mostly talked about his feelings about the relationship and why he wanted to keep it private.</p><p>“It’s not really [because I] want to be guarded and private, it’s more a response to something else,” he explained, referring to his relationship with Taylor.</p><p>"We live in a culture that is so increasingly intrusive. The more you give and frankly, even if you don’t give it, something will be taken," he added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-joe-alwyn-purposely-avoid-talking-about-taylor-swift>Did Joe Alwyn Purposely Avoid Talking About Taylor Swift?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/joe-alwyn-conversations-with-friends-nick-conway.jpg><p>Taylor had always had good things to say about her boyfriend.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In her Netflix documentary</a>, for example, she said, "I was falling in love with someone who had a wonderfully normal, balanced life. We decided together we wanted our relationship to be private. I was happy."</p><p>However, fans couldn't help but notice that Joe rarely talked about Taylor and instead focused on his need for privacy and the relationship itself. Instead of saying he was happy or how he felt about Taylor, he often defended his decision to protect his privacy.</p><p>“Someone’s private life is, by definition, private. No one is obliged to share their personal life,” he told British GQ in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Joe Alwyn Had Zero Patience For This Question About Taylor Swift (But He Handled It Calmly Anyway)</a></span></p><p>Unlike Taylor, who always praised Joe and had nice things to say about him, Joe rarely said anything about her other than to deflect and protect his privacy.</p><p>But was this because Joe didn't want to talk about Taylor, or was he simply unaccustomed to the level of interest he was receiving all of a sudden? Could it have been that both Joe and Taylor <a href=#>wanted their relationship to be quiet</a>?</p><p>That is a real possibility and gives lots of context to another Joe quote, made on yet another occasion when he was defending his right to privacy.</p><p>"So that if you're not posting all the time about what you’re doing, how you’re spending a day or how you made a breakfast, does that make you a recluse? [...] If you give it to them, it just opens the door," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrewsYyao7CxnmK1or%2BMrJiinF2Wr7DB02armrGcpL9uv9aina1lmaN6qrrTnqmvoZWswHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mel-gibson-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mel Gibson Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hailey-bieber-s-skincare-products-are-leaving-fans-furious-and-in-pain.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hailey Bieber's Skincare Products Are Leaving Fans Furious (And In Pain)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
