Others think the <a href=#>King Richard actor</a> exhibited "toxic masculinity." Regardless of the moral consensus, Rock has already declined to file a police report. Here's why.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Did Will Smith Need Two Trailers While Filming 'Men In Black 3'?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-when-will-smith-slapped-chris-rock-at-the-oscar-stage>What Happened When Will Smith Slapped Chris Rock At The Oscar Stage</h2><p>It started after Rock said this joke: "Jada. I love you. GI Jane 2. Can't wait to see it. It's … That was a that was a nice one. nice one. OK." The camera quickly panned toward the couple. Pinkett Smith rolled her eyes at the joke while Smith was seen laughing. "I'm up here. Uh oh. Richard?" the presenter said as <a href=#>the Independence Day star</a> was getting up onstage to slap him. Rock responded as if it was part of his act. "Oh, wow. Wow. Will Smith just smacked the s— out of me," he said. From his seat, the first-time Oscar winner shouted at Rock: "Keep my wife's name out your f— mouth." Then there was an uncomfortable silence in the audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not long after the altercation, Smith was called on stage to receive the Academy Award for Best Actor. He then spoke about his misconduct in his teary acceptance speech. "I'm being called on in my life to love people and to protect people and to be a river to my people," he said. "Now I know, to do what we do, you've got to be able to take abuse. You got to be able to have people talk crazy about you."</p><p>"In this business, you've got to be able to have people disrespecting you, and you've got to smile and you've got to pretend like that's OK," he continued. "What I loved - Denzel [Washington] said to me a few minutes ago, he said, 'At your highest moment, be careful, that's when the devil comes for you.' I want to be a vessel for love." Washington apparently spoke to him after the incident.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Old Was Adrienne Banfield-Norris When She Had Jada Pinkett Smith?</a></span></p><h2 id=why-chris-rock-refused-to-file-a-police-report-against-will-smith>Why Chris Rock Refused To File A Police Report Against Will Smith</h2><p>According to Variety, Rock didn't file a police report against Smith. "LAPD investigative entities are aware of an incident between two individuals during the Academy Awards program," the Los Angeles Police Department said in their statement. "The incident involved one individual slapping another. The individual involved has declined to file a police report. If the involved party desires a police report at a later date, LAPD will be available to complete an investigative report."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The comedian is yet to make a statement about the incident. However, many celebrities have already weighed in. Here's what Tiffany Hadish said as reported on Twitter by LA Times' Amy Kaufman: "I think Chris was messy. As a woman who had a husb, I wish my husb wld have stood up 4 me the way (Will) stood up 4 (Jada). That's what every woman wants, right? She was hurt. And he protected his wife. And that's what a man is supposed 2 do." <strong><a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a></strong> echoed the same opinion in a series of tweets.</p><p>"I love Chris Rock. I don't think he would've made that joke had he known what Jada recently shared- but between him & the whole team @ the #Oscars you mean to tell me not ONE of y'all heard this woman just share this heartbreaking story? #ComeOnSon," she wrote. The rapper also thought Smith did it out of love. "You just got to witness in real time what happens in a man's soul when he looks over to the woman he loves & sees her holding back tears from a 'little joke' at her expense," she continued. "This is what any & every real man feels in that instant. while y'all seeing the joke he's seeing her pain."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Really Happened Between Will Smith's Son And Phoebe Dynevor?</a></span></p><h2 id=is-will-smith-returning-his-oscar>Is Will Smith Returning His Oscar?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insiders told New York Post</a> that it's possible that Smith would be asked to return his first-ever Oscar. "It's basically assault," said the source. "Everyone was just so shocked in the room, it was so uncomfortable. I think Will would not want to give his Oscar back, but who knows what will happen now." The Academy also published a cryptic tweet about the matter: "The Academy does not condone violence of any form. Tonight we are delighted to celebrate our 94th Academy Awards winners, who deserve this moment of recognition from their peers and movie lovers around the world."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Did Rihanna Really Reject Chris Rock?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmLWztdJmqaibm2K%2FprLUrJydZaSkeqJ5xaKjnmWgpLmqr8RmqZ6on6fBbq3GmqCnq6RixKq4y2aqpqGknXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-cameron-hardin-on-dancing-with-myself-his-wife-net-worth-and-more-facts-to-know.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Cameron Hardin On Dancing With Myself ?
