Cillian Murphy scored big with $10 million. However, the biggest salary went to director Christopher Nolan.

I had a previous fair understanding of Strauss because I was fascinated with the mechanics of warfare, particularly in the Pacific theater in World War II. The first time I saw his name in print was regarding the proximity fuze and its development."</p><p>We can safely say Downey Jr.'s trust in Nolan worked out pretty well.
