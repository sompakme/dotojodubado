A "showmance" is when houseguests fall for each other in the house and usually become a "couple." This typically results in the duo being split up by one of the members being voted out of the house. There have been numerous <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">showmances over the years</a>, but there are only a select few who have made it into a legit romance.</p><p>Some couples dated outside the house and broke up later and some are still together to this day.

After they left the house they began dating, and then eventually got engaged in the Big Brother house. A bit before getting engaged, the couple competed on The Amazing Race 31 with a few other BB pairs. Their wedding was delayed due to the pandemic, but they just recently tied the knot and are expecting their first child.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Years Later: What Are The Housemates Of 'Big Brother' Season 13 Up To Now?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cody-nickson-and-jessica-graf><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Cody Nickson And Jessica Graf</span></h2><p>Season 19's Jessica and Cody are still together today.

The couple became a quick target in the house after they started their showmance and got separated once they got voted out due to pre-jury and jury. To test their relationship even more, the pair competed on The Amazing Race 30 after leaving the Big Brother house and won.</p><h2 id=chris-swaggy-c-williams-and-bayleigh-dayton><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Chris 'Swaggy C' Williams And Bayleigh Dayton</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swaggy C and Bayleigh had a complicated relationship.
