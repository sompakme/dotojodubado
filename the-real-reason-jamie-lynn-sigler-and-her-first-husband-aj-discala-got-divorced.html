According to Forbes, she was only 22 years old at the time, and he was 32.</p><p>There isn't a lot of information about the couple's relationship or what it was like for the actress when they broke up. However, according to the Arizona Daily Star, the fact that Discala was ten years older than Sigler caused issues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/aj-discala-jamie-lynn-sigler.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Sigler hasn't explained why her first marriage ended, this does sound possible. She was only 16 when she began playing Meadow Soprano on The Sopranos. Since the TV series aired from 1999 to 2007, she was still filming the series at the time of her divorce.</p><p>As she approached her mid-20s, it's plausible that she realized that this wasn't the right relationship for her and she wanted to be on her own.
