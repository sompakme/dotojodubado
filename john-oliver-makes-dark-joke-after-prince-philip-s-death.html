I believe that family is familiar with one another,” he continued.</p><p>Oliver added: “In the way that they can’t be close emotionally, they certainly are close biologically.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'The Crown’ Actor Josh O’Connor Will Star In Queer Period Horror From Director Francis Lee</a></span></p><h2 id=oliver-s-prescient-remarks-on-meghan-markle>Oliver’s Prescient Remarks On Meghan Markle</h2><p>This isn’t the first time Oliver has offered his humorous, critical take on the Royal Family.</p><p>In 2018, he made some prescient comments on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Meghan Markle</strong></a> joining the Royal Family ahead of her wedding to Prince Harry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Oliver anticipated that marrying into a royal family was going to be an emotionally taxing experience for the former actress.</p><p>“I would not blame her if she pulled out of this at the last minute,” Oliver told Stephen Colbert in 2018.</p><p>“I don’t think you need to have just seen the pilot episode of <i>The Crown </i>to get a basic sense that she might be marrying into a family that could cause her some emotional complications," Oliver added.</p><p>The host and comedian also said he, a commoner, wouldn’t dream of marrying into the royal family as he knew he wouldn’t “be welcomed”.</p><p>“I hope she likes it, it’s going to be weird for her,” the comedian also said.</p><p>Oliver’s comments resurfaced after the explosive interview given by Markle and Prince Harry to Oprah Winfrey last March.</p><p>Markle and Prince Harry agreed to sit down for a two-hour interview with Winfrey.
