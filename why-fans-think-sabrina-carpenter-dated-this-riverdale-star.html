He said in an interview, “I always wanted to be good at sports but I just wasn’t, my dad always says I’m a late bloomer.” During his junior high school years, he had participated in his first school play and then began performing in local theaters in Ohio.

She said, “He’s such a great actor, and I think like especially when we were looking for the person – obviously with music videos, it’s also kind of last minute. Not all the time, but it was one of those things where it was like, ‘Okay. We’re shooting this in three days, and we don’t have someone.’ And I was such a fan of him because I know he's such a good actor.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sabrina, <a href=#>who reportedly amassed $4 million net worth</a>, and Casey’s chemistry really showed the screen, but their relationship didn’t extend offscreen.
