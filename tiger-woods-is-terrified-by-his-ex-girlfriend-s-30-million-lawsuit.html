According to court documents, Erica claims she was forced out of Tiger’s home following their October split, despite having “<a href=#>an ‘oral tenancy agreement’ relating to the Residence</a>.”</p><p>However, Erica isn’t directly suing Tiger, but rather is naming the Jupiter Island Irrevocable Homestead Trust as the defendant. She claims the trust convinced her to go on vacation following the break-up.</p><p>However, she was then notified at the airport that she was being locked out of the residence and wouldn’t be allowed back in following her return.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Cardi B & Offset’s $7 Million McDonald’s Campaign Is Under Fire</a></span></p><p>Erica said she had an oral agreement with Tiger and the trust that would allow her to live in the residence for the next five years, which she says was violated by the trust’s actions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Erica says the trust temporarily paid for her to stay in a hotel room as well as other living expenses. The trust also arranged to remove her personal items from the residence without her permission. Now, she’s seeking $30 million in damages from the trouble she says the situation caused.</p><p>Despite not being named as a defendant, Tiger has gotten his legal team involved in the lawsuits. Court documents reveal he’s seeking to intervene as he has a “a substantial, direct, and sufficient interest in this litigation to support intervention.” He’s also the beneficiary of the trust along with his two kids.</p><p>Tiger filed a response with the court, denying that he ever had a written or oral tenancy agreement with his ex-girlfriend. He also claims that he arranged for Erica to stay at a “local luxury resort and provided funds she could apply toward a new residence.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The athlete says that Erica’s decision to sue the trust and not him was a calculated move “to avoid an agreement Plaintiff made to arbitrate all disputes with Mr. Woods.”</p><p>Tiger hasn’t directly commented on the ongoing situation, but sources say he’s mortified that it’s going to turn into a scandal comparable to his divorce from Elin Nordegren. The former couple split in 2010 after Tiger’s multiple infidelities were exposed.</p><p>"<a href=#>Tiger feels like this is another shakedown</a>," a source told PEOPLE. "He doesn't want another scandal. "The insider continued, "It terrifies him […] and she knows that because they've talked about it."</p><p>"There's a lot of panic right now […] no one wants the details of a long relationship to be made public,” the source added, calling it a “nightmare for him.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:<a href=#> Jay-Z’s Marijuana Brand Is Being Sued For Illegal Activities</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>The Athletic</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqrPEq2Swp5%2BZwG610marnqqinrOqscNmmbJlmJ7AbrHXZp6iqpybv6qxzZ2qZmtgYrqquMuipqdlnJbEtMHIrWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-did-shy-glizzy-do-sky-bri-accusations-explored-amid-white-girl-video-shoot-controversy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What did Shy Glizzy do?
