His first starring role came in the 1966 movie <i>Dead Heat On A Merry-Go-Round</i>, which disappointed the producers. Due to his less-than-successful career, Ford worked as a part-time carpenter while scouting for movie parts. His big role came when George Lucas cast him in 1973’s <i>American Graffiti</i>. He later worked small roles in Francis Ford Coppola’s <i>The Conversation </i>and <i>Apocalypse Now</i>. His breakthrough occurred when he starred in George Lucas’ <i>Star Wars: A New Hope</i>, and the rest is cinema history. His classic role led him to another, which was followed by another, and Ford ultimately became <a href=#>one of the most legendary actors in the industry</a>.</p><p>From starring in hit franchises like <i>Star Wars </i>and <i>Indiana Jones</i> to taking on famous roles in solo movies, Harrison Ford has made millions from his movies. His net worth currently stands at $230 million, given that he has collectible real estate properties and aviation planes in his portfolio. Let’s take a look at how Harrison Ford’s fortune rakes up to $230 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=earnings-from-star-wars>Earnings From Star Wars</h2><p>Harrison Ford’s <i>Star Wars</i> character Han Solo has become one of the most iconic characters in cinema history. Starring in <a href=#>a hit franchise</a> earned Harrison quite a sizable fortune. Ford first starred in the original <i>Star Wars</i> film called <i>A New Hope</i>, for which he was only paid $10,000 in 1977, which would be $40,000 currently, as noted by <a href=#>The Things</a>. For <i>Empire Strikes Back</i>, Ford earned $100,000, which would be $400,000 in the present day. Following that, <i>The Return Of The Jedi</i> saw Ford earning five times more than his salary pay cut for the first movie, a whopping $500,000. His biggest paycheck came from the hit 2015 sequel <i>The Force Awakens</i>, which earned him $25 million, which consisted of $15 million in salary and 1% of box office earnings.</p><h2 id=earnings-from-indiana-jones>Earnings From Indiana Jones</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ford has had the privilege of working in not one but two iconic franchises, <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Indiana Jones</i>.

The second installment observed a dip in his salary to $4.5 million for <i>Temple Of Doom</i> and a hike to $4.9 million for <i>The Last Crusade</i>.

He purchased a Brentwood home in 1983 for $1 million, and he sold the estate for $8.2 million in 2012. His primary residence in LA was another Brentwood home which he purchased for $12 million along with his wife. He owns three additional properties in LA. He also purchased a $5.3 million penthouse in New York in 2001. His biggest purchase is near the town of Jackson, Wyoming, where he owns an 800-acre ranch house along the Snake River.</p><p>Apart from owning lavish homes, Ford took things a step further when he purchased a Cessna Citation Sovereign 680 in 2009, which has a 3,200 nautical mile range and requires two pilots in the cockpit. As mentioned by <a href=#>GQ</a>, the twin-engine jet reportedly cost $18.8 million. Ford is also a trained helicopter pilot, and he bought a Bell 407GX helicopter for $3 million in 2013.
