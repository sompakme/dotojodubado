The star became an overnight success and instantly transformed into a fan favorite. Pauly, who was known for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his hilarious catchphrases</a> from "cabs are here!" to "t-shirt time," the reality star turn DJ brought it each and every episode. As the show came to an end after five seasons, Pauly went on to have an immensely successful career in music, however, it seems as if things weren't going so great when it came to his love life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Jersey Shore star has not been linked to many women throughout his career, however, it appears as if that has all changed. During the MTV reboot, Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, Pauly introduced the crew to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his new girlfriend, Nikki Hall</a>. It goes without saying that she was welcomed with open arms by Pauly's Seaside Heights family, but exactly how did the two meet? Let's find out!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>‘Jersey Shore’s’ Pauly D Can't Wait To Do This In 2021</a></span></p><h2 id=how-pauly-d-met-girlfriend-nikki-hall>How Pauly D Met Girlfriend Nikki Hall</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pauly-D-Nikki-Hall-Shot-At-Love-MTV-e1612129498181.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During last week's episode of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, Pauly D introduced his Jersey Shore family to Nikki Hall, the DJ's new girlfriend. While Pauly's bestie and fellow castmate, Vinny Guadagnino had already met Nikki, it was the first time for Mike, Ronnie, Deena, and Angelina, and it is safe to say it all went over well. Although their first dinner together as a group may have been awkward, mainly due to lingering tension between Deena and Angelina,&nbsp;it still ended off on a high note.</p><p>Despite the awkwardness, the group welcomed Nikki with open arms, and fans did not expect anything less. This was quite a big deal for Pauly D, who has never really had a public relationship before. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The star dated Aubrey O'Day</a> back in 2015 after meeting her on Famously Single, however, after over a year and a half of dating, the two called it quits. Luckily for Pauly, that wouldn't be his only go at reality TV meets dating. In 2019, Pauly embarked on a journey with MTV in his own dating show spin-off, A Shot At Love With Pauly D, <strong>which is where he met Nikki Hall!</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Pauly D’s Girlfriend Is Repping ‘Jersey Shore’ In Her Recent Makeup Tutorial Post</a></span></p><p>Nikki was a contestant on the first season and even returned for the second season, which changed to Doube Shot At Love as it featured both Pauly and Vinny. This time around, Pauly and Nikki grew closer together and eventually fell for one another. After the show wrapped, the two officially began dating and have been going strong ever since!</p><p>Things turned real serious between the two when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikki met Pauly's daughter</a>, Amabella, making it clear that Hall could very well be "the one". While Vinny is having a hard time seeing his bestie with someone else, both Vin and Pauly's fans are ecstatic for the star and cannot wait to see where this relationship takes both him and Nikki.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>This Is The Reason Pauly D’s Hair Hasn’t Moved Since 2003</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9Zmp5qtnK56pXnMnqtmoJmoeqi10aWdq6GVo7FuusikoqJlmJa5rXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-multiple-tragedies-have-affected-luke-bryan-s-music.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Multiple Tragedies Have Affected Luke Bryan's Music</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fitness-leads-unleashed-introducing-gym-pillars-george-liu.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fitness Leads Unleashed: Introducing Gym Pillars &amp;amp; George Liu</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
