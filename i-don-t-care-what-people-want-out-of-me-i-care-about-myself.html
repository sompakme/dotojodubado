He delivered his most reckless lyrics in a diabolical yelp and his personal reflections in a lower, more somber tone, like Biggie in a duet with himself on Ready to Die’s “Gimme the Loot.” The dichotomy left laugh-a-minute party jams for casual listeners and heady verses for sticklers for bars, leading to a uniquely slippery career: Brown holding court with dance-pop darlings like Charli XCX and Purity Ring on his 2013 album, Old; rap heavyweights like Kendrick Lamar, who graced the 2016 heater “Really Doe”; and producer-wizard types like Paul White and the Alchemist, who both contribute beats to Quaranta, Brown’s sixth studio album and a bookend to the autobiographical spirit of XXX.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp1tedm3001i3b6vyy5nbpru@published data-word-count=173>When we spoke on Halloween, he seemed excited to get the record out of the pipeline, framing it as a farewell to pained and diaristic writing. It must be daunting music to make. “Jenn’s Terrific Vacation” is about watching gentrification warp your hometown. “Down With It” teeters over the void, fighting trust and substance-abuse issues to commit in a relationship. Brown moved to Austin from his hometown of Detroit three years ago hoping to prioritize his health. He looks and sounds happier now. This year, he was a riot on the rip-roaring Danny Brown Show with Tom Segura and Christina P. and as co-star of the acclaimed Scaring the Hoes, a team-up with rapper-producer JPEGMAFIA. But the week after Hoes dropped, Brown had checked into rehab. Quaranta appears to document the emotional turmoil that led him to change his life. As he prepares for another tour, he is already conceptualizing another presumably more upbeat work and plotting a deeper push into comedy and figuring out how to obsess over video games without weed.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp1jtkzn001p3b7z5clvn7tg@published data-word-count=115><strong>You tend to take your time with a new release, but we had two this year, between Scaring the Hoes and Quaranta. The last time you doubled up was 2011, the year XXX and Black and Brown! landed. How is it that we’ve gotten this much music from you in 2023?</strong><br>COVID, shit. We was sitting around so much, so I was making a lot of music, to be honest. The majority of Quaranta was recorded during COVID. I mean, we worked on Scaring the Hoes for two years. Usually I’m touring a lot and working a lot, and it’s harder to sit around and focus on music, but that’s all I had for a minute.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp1jtl37001q3b7zu336uapq@published data-word-count=40><strong>How did it feel being off the road for that long?</strong><br>It was horrible, because I was going through a lot of different situations. It was like everything happened at once. It was a bad time for me, to be honest.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp1jtl5n001r3b7zt4x464xc@published data-word-count=17><strong>I don’t want to be all </strong><strong>“</strong><strong>So, how</strong><strong> are </strong><strong>you?,” but … how are you?</strong><br>I’m great now.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp1jtl8v001s3b7zbojr2599@published data-word-count=115><strong>I’ve heard you refer to the new album as a “trauma dump.” I was thinking about all the classic rap that technically qualifies. You could say Geto Boys’ “Mind Playing Tricks on Me” is a trauma dump. What brought that out on this record?</strong><br>Really, for me, it’s a therapy type of situation. As men, we feel uncomfortable being emotional in some sense. The best way for me to get it out is through my music. Now, I actually go to real therapy. I don’t really have to use music as an outlet like that anymore. It’s not something I consciously do. Sometimes, the shit come out in songs. And it helps me get through it.</p><span class="quote has-quote-marks">People love a train wreck.

How are you feeling about the tour?</strong><br>I’m actually excited. We did the Scaring the Hoes tour with me being sober. I was really worried about it until I got into the swing of things. Before, when I was in my drinking and drugging and all that shit, I had this feeling of just wanting to get everything over with. With touring, there’s a lot of downtime. You’re sitting around. I get excited to play shows now. I feel like a lot of my drinking started with being on the road and nervous. Really, I was making shit harder on myself, going about it that way. Now, it’s fun just to be onstage playing music for the people that enjoy it and seeing them have a good time.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp1jtlem001u3b7zxy87yorn@published data-word-count=108><strong>After Gucci Mane got sober, I started to wonder what it’s like leaving that wild reputation behind. Is there a certain portion of the audience that’s just always going to want to see you at your most chaotic?</strong><br>That’s there with everything you do in life. People love a train wreck. But that ain’t productive for my life. I don’t care what people want out of me. I care about myself more than the perception of me. What’s healthier for me is what’s more important to me, so I have to focus on that. I can’t care what other people think. I’ve never been that type of guy anyway.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp1jtlgp001v3b7z31sil7k4@published data-word-count=107><strong>How is your experience of Austin different from life in Detroit?</strong><br>I can live a healthier lifestyle here. It’s a lot less stress, just dealing with family and friends and living in sobriety now. My friends still party. I don’t want to be Debbie Downer all the time. When I moved away, it was initially to start to focus on my health. I was dating a girl out here and going back and forth all the time. We were getting more and more serious. Then, I was talking to Tom Segura, who was moving to Austin. It was a no-brainer for me. I was already thinking about it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp1ooukz003t3b7zwx5oznij@published data-word-count=87>We always talked about doing a podcast together, but they did it out of L.A., and I wasn’t really planning on being in L.A. like that. I always told him I really didn’t want to do a podcast, but if I did do one, I’d do it with them, because I liked the way they ran their business. Anybody can set a camera up in their bedroom and talk in front of it. They take it serious, and I take everything I do serious in some sense.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp1jtlip001w3b7zt3xblub2@published data-word-count=207><strong>The </strong><a href=#><strong>first episode</strong></a><strong> immediately gave me a headache from laughing. You were talking about a girl whose parrot learned YG lyrics. I feel like you could step right into stand-up if you wanted. Is that something you’re interested in?</strong><br>Definitely, because I have some of the funniest people in the world telling me I should do it. If I got people like that telling me it’s something I should do, it’s something I want to do. But I’m still too focused on music right now. It’s still kind of hard for me to transition from writing songs to writing jokes. I still really can’t grasp the concept. It’s easy for me to talk random shit and be funny, but to sit down and figure it out has kind of been difficult. It’s a process. In the industry, I’m hanging around more comics than rappers, and they’re giving me confidence. But just like anything else, you’re going to suck at it for a minute. I’ve got to be able to have the heart to suck at it for now. I don’t. I’ve still got a few more albums in me, so I want to focus on music. I’ve been making a lot more music since I’ve been in Texas.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp1jtln2001y3b7z3xc7rgj3@published data-word-count=181><strong>“Jenn’s Terrific Vacation” might be the hardest song I ever heard about gentrification.

I can’t even take credit for that one. It just happened. I didn’t think hard about it. I had just moved to downtown Detroit. This was before everything got shut down with COVID. It was what I was seeing. I was seeing places that used to literally be crack dens — downtown Detroit used to be like a ghost town. Every now and then, something happened and it’d be cracking. For the most part, it was crackheads and prostitutes. Now, it’s dog parks and a lot of rich white people that would usually be living in the suburbs. But the city was looking good. Then COVID happened, and it was a dark place.

In “Y.B.P.” you talk about feeling “stuck in the middle between </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Blade</strong></a><strong> and Dilla.”</strong><br>I always felt like that. Detroit has always had two sides to it: music where you can go to a fancy restaurant in some village in Europe and it’s playing, and street rap. In the States, street rap has gotten popular in the last five to ten years, but it’s always been popular in Detroit. Even with me … you ain’t gonna hear no cars riding past blasting Danny Brown, but you would hear some Sada Baby. It’s a crazy duality. I feel like I’m more of a street guy than a Dilla guy when it comes to my music. I lived more of the street lifestyle the Sada Babys talk about than the backpack open-mic life, but that’s the scene that made my career start to work. I’m a fan of them both. When I started out rapping in Detroit, it was more from the street side of being around the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chedda Boyz</a> and stuff like that. I was the middle guy. No scene really fucked with me.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp1jtlut001z3b7zxid46ee1@published data-word-count=234><strong>Itsthereal’s </strong><a href=#><strong>Blog Era</strong></a><strong> podcast revisits the Wild West moment when the power in mainstream hip-hop music and media shifted dramatically.

The first time I ever got posted on a blog, I was in jail. My brother was sending out songs I recorded before I got locked up. This CO that was cool with me was letting me come down on weekends because he was into hip-hop. We would just look up blogs. I was locked up for a year. After a year away from hip-hop, you don’t know what the fuck is going on once you get out. I was able to still tap in and find out what was going on. That’s when Hip Hop Havoc was a thing. We had checked Hip Hop Havoc, and one of my songs was on there. It blew my mind. I was like, “Oh shit!” It made me feel like when I got out of jail, that’s what I was going to do. I was going to hit the blogs hard. “This is who’s fucking with me.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp1tnsn4001z3b6voumyhb1m@published data-word-count=85>Now anybody can log on YouTube and drop a song. We need a little gatekeeping now. Older guys come from the school where it was all about being original. If you wasn’t original, niggas didn’t fuck with you. You was a biter.

I’m moving on to something else now. I feel like I’ve made these kinds of albums for a minute, but I’m at a happier place in life. I want to make music that reflects that now. I didn’t understand the power of that emotional shit. People would hit me up about certain songs, like, “That shit really helped me.” I’d be like, “Damn, I was fucked-up, and that was a sad song.” I just want to make music to make people happy now. I’m on that art imitates life. I’m not saying it ain’t going to be bars, because that’s what’s always going to be there. It irks me when I see an artist that never grows and continuously makes the same song and sticks to that. I almost feel like I’m being scammed. Me and Peggy had this joke while making the Scaring the Hoes album. A lot of these rappers are like Fortnite. We’re the fucking Dark Souls of the shit.
