All the news is good news in his world right now as he participates in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a movie role</a>, continues to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">promote Fabletics for Men</a>, and indulges in his true love, comedy. He's carrying the comedic conversation through to his podcast, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recently featured Jerry Seinfeld</a>, and of course, through his radio show which is featured on Sirius XM.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the true spirit of keeping things light and free spirited, the funny maker posted a hysterical collage featuring images of his friends to Instagram and he wants to know what you think about it. In fact, has invited fans to weigh in on 'who is the dumbest?'</p><h2 id=keeping-it-light>Keeping It Light</h2><p>So many people can use a good laugh these days, and Kevin Hart is definitely a great resource. He posted this fabulously funny image of&nbsp;&nbsp;radio host Dwayne Brown, Spank Horton, Harry Ratchford, Na'Im Lynn, and Joey Wells, and each of them is making a fabulously funny face.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's a square grid collage of each person's face and Kevin Hart is included in the madness. Clearly they've had a competition on the radio show, and are vying for top spot in being the 'dumbest', so they've left it up to fans to cast the final vote and make the ultimate decision.</p><p>Of course, a little added pressure is always an interesting element to any healthy competition, so Kevin Hart and his pals have a friendly bet going on here as well, and there's some money at stake.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Hart Creates A Tequila Brand That Will Go Up Against Tequila Made By The Rock</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-weigh-in>Fans Weigh In</h2><p>Without an official outlet to tally these fun-filled votes, fans have excitedly engaged with the stars by launching their commentary to Kevin Hart's Instagram feed, and their votes and notes are as funny as the post itself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hart's comment section is flooded with messages such as; "Definitely Spank," and "Sorry Spank you kool and all but your SPECIAL as my mom would say." Others said; "Spank just had to try and be pretty. Smh," and "As much as I fw you Kev... youâ€™re a whole clown dawg ðŸ˜­ after you itâ€™s spank."</p><p>The majority of the votes definitely went to Spank, and he was the clear winner, although Kevin himself got some votes in with comments like; "As much as I fw you Kev... youâ€™re a whole clown dawg ðŸ˜­ after you itâ€™s spank," and "Everyone is great!
