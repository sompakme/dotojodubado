Between Men in Black, Independence Day, <a href=#>The X-Files</a>, Mars Attacks! and Contact, it’s fair to say that <a href=#>Hollywood was obsessed with E.T.s</a> in the ’90s, but perhaps nothing reflected the phenomenon so well as 3rd Rock From the Sun.</p><p>The sitcom, which debuted in January 1996, had one of the strangest premises in TV history. Four extraterrestrial visitors — played by <a href=#><strong>John Lithgow</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kristen Johnston</strong></a>, <strong>French Stewart</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</strong></a> — pretended to be a human family living near Cleveland, Ohio, as they conducted research on human society for their home planet.</p><p>Using the surname Solomon as an alias, the group reported to an off-world boss called the Big Giant Head, who was at first unseen but eventually appeared in the form of <a href=#><strong>William Shatner</strong></a>. They were also friendly with a local anthropologist named Dr. Mary Albright, played by <strong>Jane Curtin</strong> (who herself played an alien on <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> and in the spinoff movie Coneheads).</p><p>It’s weird stuff, but in 1997, the show <a href=#>took home the most Emmys</a> of any show nominated that year, winning in five of eight categories including Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for Lithgow and Johnston, respectively.</p><p>The show also won two <a href=#>Screen Actors Guild</a> trophies during its run and took home two <a href=#>Golden Globes</a> in 1996 for its first season.</p><p>Though his turn as Dick Solomon garnered a ton of critical acclaim and industry recognition, Lithgow required a tough sell before agreeing to appear on the show. He had <a href=#>already turned down a role on Cheers</a> — instead, Frasier Crane, who later got his own spinoff, was performed by <a href=#><strong>Kelsey Grammer</strong></a>.</p><p>When husband-and-wife cocreators <strong>Bonnie and Terry Turner</strong> invited him out to breakfast one day, the Tony winner had no idea they were really trying to convince him to star on 3rd Rock.</p><p>“I thought, ‘How am I going to say no as graciously as I can and get out of here?’” the actor recalled in a 2012 interview with the Television Academy. However, the pair quickly changed his mind: “Within five minutes, [they’d] persuaded me to be in 3rd Rock From the Sun.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since the show aired its final episode in May 2001, several of its cast members have gone on to appear in other iconic series, including <a href=#>Sex and the City</a> and <a href=#>The Crown</a>.</p><p>Keep scrolling to find out what the Solomons and their friends have been up to since the sitcom’s end:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq19ov6V50aiapGWWp7yuedOhnGarpaN6pK3SrWSwoJWnsm6t0Z5kraCVrnqvu9Zo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./daniel-day-lewis-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Daniel Day-Lewis Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-josh-swickard-dating-josh-swickard-girlfriend-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Josh Swickard dating?
