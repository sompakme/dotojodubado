Some end up despising their role if their movie bombed, and some didn't like the script but were forced into a film because of a movie contract with a studio. And then there are actors who disparage the films that made them stars, and we wonder why there's so much animosity, especially when the film did well at the box office. For Kate Winslet, for example, she detested her performance in Titanic and didn't want to be in the film, despite the fact that&nbsp;Titanic made Winslet an instant star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And then there's the flip side, actors who have no regrets about the parts they played. This surprises us for the most part because they are defending movies that were critically trashed or did so bad at the box-office upon release that in most cases it puts the actor's career in jeopardy. These actors aren't gods; they're mortals like us and sometimes they have moments they utterly regret and moments that they don't regret at all, even though they probably should. So here are 12 actors who have major regrets about a film, as well as 12 actors who have absolutely none.</p><h2 id=regrets-carrie-fisher-the-star-wars-original-trilogy>Regrets: Carrie Fisher, The Star Wars Original Trilogy</h2><p><a href=#>Carrie Fisher</a> reprised her iconic role as Princess Leia in 2015's "Star Wars: The Force Awakens." She told <a href=#>Time</a>&nbsp;that the only reason she returned to the part was because&nbsp;it was "difficult to get work after [turning] 30" for women in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But back in 2008, Fisher revealed to The Today Show that <a href=#>if she had known how famous she would become playing the princess in the original Star Wars franchise, she would've never done it</a>. It didn't matter to her that she became an icon for women for her feisty attitude in the trilogy.

Somehow the movie eventually became a high-camp cult classic like The Big Lebowski. <a href=#>Here's what Berkeley said</a>,</p><p>“I had the most extraordinary experience making the film. . . . When a dream is happening, it’s unlike anything you can ever imagine.” She added: "You guys and the love you have for this movie have made this the cult film that it is. . . .I really do want you to know this movie is something I love, but I love it because you love it too.” (Source: People)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=regrets-bill-murray-garfield>Regrets: Bill Murray, Garfield</h2><p><a href=#>Bill Murray</a> lent his&nbsp;voice to the animated movie Garfield in which the famous cat was entirely CGI.

It was a moment where I could say, 'I had all the power in the world and could do whatever I wanted'. Not a lot of people get that opportunity, and I did what I wanted to do."

In 2011, Damon trashed the script, which he called&nbsp;<a href=#>"unreadable,"</a> and was secretly angry at the time that Universal Pictures wanted to go ahead with the film. Since he was contractually obliged to appear in the Ultimatum, he had no gag order and went to town <a href=#>taking down the script:</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I don't blame Tony for taking a boatload of money and handing in what he handed in.
