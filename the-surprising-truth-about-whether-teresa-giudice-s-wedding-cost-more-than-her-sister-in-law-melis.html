According to Us Weekly, Melissa and Joe weren't happy that people spread allegations that Melissa had been unfaithful to Joe and Teresa was aware of that.</p><p>Back in 2004, when Melissa and Joe Gorga got married, things were definitely less dramatic.

She said, "We are one of the longest-standing couples on reality TV in general.

It was painful for Melissa Gorga to realize that she hadn't been asked.

Teresa can, however, and she definitely spent quite a lot of money. According to Us Weekly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teresa spent almost $10,000 on her hair for her wedding</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Teresa-Melissa-RHONJ.jpg><p>Lucia Casazza, a hairstylist who works with Teresa, was interviewed in August 2022 on Andy Cohen Live on SiriusXM. She explained that Teresa used "over $7,000 worth of extensions … and that kind of styling cost $2,500." Teresa also needed a lot of bobby pins (1,500 to be exact).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Casazza also said, “As we know, Teresa is the queen of Jersey.

Since Teresa got married after years of being a famous reality star, that added some extra costs.</p><p>According to Page Six, Teresa was upset when The Real Housewives of New York City star Ramona Singer shared the wedding invitation on her Instagram account. Teresa didn't want that getting out and was worried about strangers knowing the time, date, and location.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/luis-ruelas-teresa-giudice.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Teresa was interviewed on a Live! Casino & Hotel panel in August 2022 and said that she spent extra cash on security guards. She also had to send out more invitations. Teresa explained, "The second invitation I sent out was a rose box. Instead of them bringing them home, I sent them to their house. But it cost me extra money for postage and extra money for security. So thank you, Ramona.”</p><p>Teresa also seems to have paid a lot for her wedding dress. According to People, Mark Zurino, who created the dress, shared on Instagram that it was "a custom Mark Zunino Atelier blush mermaid gown that featured over 300 yards of hand-draped English netting. The train was over 100 inches long accented in crystal and pearl details with long white beaded evening gloves to match." While the exact cost is unknown, that must have been pricey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it's sad that Teresa Giudice's sister-in-law Melissa Gorga and brother Joe Gorga weren't there on her wedding day, Teresa seems to have had an incredible time. As RHONJ fans know, it remains to be seen whether Teresa and Melissa can ever get to a better place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqbKzsdKaZKChpZm2pLHSZq6enJSeu6h5wqiqrWWdpL%2BmedOhmKdlo57AtbHRZqCnZZyWxG65xKWgrKuRYrSwvsaaqmablaeyrrvNsmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-really-happened-between-britney-spears-and-jason-alexander.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Really Happened Between Britney Spears And Jason Alexander?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-net-worth-of-the-cast-of-barbie-ranked.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Net Worth Of The Cast Of 'Barbie', Ranked</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
