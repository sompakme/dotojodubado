Our favorite game of strategy and survival is back with its 41st season, having taken a hiatus during the pandemic. The ending to last season felt a bit disjointed, as the finale – a couple months after filming and during which the winner is crowned – took place via Zoom. Now the show is back to its former iteration, leaving fans more excited than ever to dive into the madness. At the helm of the show, of course, is <a href=#>longtime host</a> Jeff Probst, who also serves as an executive producer on the show. He is the face of Survivor, having been the host since its inception in 2000 and being very involved in the format and decision-making throughout its 21-year lifespan. Jeff Probst is so entrenched in the Survivor universe, in fact, that it's almost impossible to conjure an image of him not in some remote, tropical location residing over Tribal Council. Jeff Probst in his own kitchen making coffee? Can't picture it! But he had to find something to do during these long 18 months, and we wanted to know what. Everyone drop your buffs, here's everything Jeff Probst got up to during quarantine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-pitched-a-new-version-of-39-survivor-39><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Pitched A New Version Of 'Survivor'</span></h2><p>Jeff Probst has spoken frequently about the need for the show to evolve constantly in response to current conditions, and that's a big reason the show has, erm, survived so long already. When the pandemic shut down production in mid-March 2020, Jeff Probst sprang into action, pitching Mike White on his new vision: a shorter competition at just 26 days, no food rations, smaller tribes, and various other twists and advantages.</p><h2 id=he-was-stuck-in-hawaii-for-3-months><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Was Stuck In Hawaii For 3 Months</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tough life! Jeff Probst was in Hawaii with his family, an annual trip, when the COVID lockdown began. He and his wife Lisa Ann Russell, along with her two teenage children, ended up staying there for about 3 1/2 months. <a href=#>He called</a> this period "probably the best three and a half months of [his] last 20 years." We would do that too, if we had <a href=#>his budget</a>!<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Think This Is Easily The Worst 'Survivor' Player In The History Of The Sho</a></span></p><h2 id=he-learned-something-about-himself><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Learned Something About Himself</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From his time in Hawaii, Jeff Probst says he learned something important about his truest nature. "Here’s what I learned – that I am a commune type of guy," <a href=#>he said</a>. "I just need a neighborhood with maybe 12 houses and I’ll pick the 12 families that live in it … everything should go pretty well, we’ll cook for each other, we’ll hang out, we won’t hang out, I don’t really need a giant world, I just need my little circle."</p><h2 id=he-paid-tribute-to-a-39-survivor-39-player-who-passed-away><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Paid Tribute To A 'Survivor' Player Who Passed Away</span></h2><p>Sunday Burquest, a player in 2016's Millennials vs. Gen X season, passed away in April 2021, and the Survivor universe came together to honor her and remember her excellent game on the show. Fans were touched when Jeff Probst <a href=#>paid tribute</a> to her after her death, saying, "Sunday Burquest had one of the brightest smiles of any person to ever play Survivor. She radiated kindness and understanding. She seemed to understand better than most, that life is for living, so say yes to life whenever possible. My condolences go out to her family and friends."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Top 10 Former 'Survivor' Contestants Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=he-was-making-tough-decisions-about-the-next-location><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Was Making Tough Decisions About The Next Location</span></h2><p>Apparently Season 41 was almost shot in Georgia or Hawaii. Due to filming complications from COVID, Jeff Probst and other producers had to make some choices about where the next filming location could be, logistically. No hate to Hawaii or Georgia, but... we're glad they straightened things out and ultimately filmed in Fiji.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Survivor' Fans Still Stand By Season 15 Contestant Denise Martin</a></span></p><h2 id=he-played-a-lot-of-tennis><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Played A Lot Of Tennis</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fallout Boy bassist Pete Wentz told GQ that he plays tennis with Jeff Probst all the time, and that the Survivor host is actually quite competitive in the robust Los Angeles tennis scene. "He’s very competitive," <a href=#>said the musician</a>. “It’s good for me, ’cause my coach is, like, ‘Dude, you gotta care.'"</p><h2 id=he-celebrated-the-show-39-s-20th-and-21st-anniversary><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Celebrated The Show's 20th (And 21st) Anniversary</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Survivor premiered on May 31, 2000. May 31, 2020 made it 20 years since the show first captivated American audiences, not yet overloaded with reality television options, and Jeff Probst knows that a two-decade run is nothing to shake a stick at. Especially in the modern internet era with shortening attention spans and less emphasis on creative integrity, a show surviving this long and staying relevant is a feat. On May 31, 2021, the show's 21st birthday, Jeff Probst <a href=#>tweeted</a>: "I can’t believe it’s been 21 years since the series premiere of @survivorcbs. I wanted to find time today to recognize all the loyal fans for the continued support, we would not be going 21 years strong without you. Thank you, I can’t wait for you to see S41 on @CBS in the fall."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Survivor: 10 Winners That Have 'Made It' The Biggest Since Their Season</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWiv4ysrKuumau8s3nHqKqtZZqas6d5z6umm6ukYq%2Bmsc1mrKllpKR6pcHRoqWgZaGqrrOtza2gp51f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-pics-of-young-divas-who-will-outshine-their-wwe-parents-soon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Pics Of Young Divas Who Will Outshine Their WWE Parents Soon</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mom-details-every-parents-nightmare-with-stepmom-who-has-no-boundaries.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mom Details Every Parents Nightmare With Stepmom Who Has No Boundaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
