These include the likes of Ellen DeGeneres, Neil Patrick Harris, Jane Lynch, Jim Parsons, Guillermo Diaz, Sarah Paulson, Kristen Stewart, Ellen Page, Wentworth Miller, and many others. And while they are all applauded and respected for making this big decision and becoming a voice for the LGBTQ community, there are also other celebrities who are fighting a different battlefront. In their case, there has been widespread speculation that they are gay even if they are living straight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, these celebrities are being persuaded to come out when there is essentially nothing to come out about. Perhaps, it’s because they agreed to portray a role on the big screen. On the other hand, some are rumored to be gay simply because they were spotted going around with someone.</p><p>Curious to find out which celebs have been trying to fight off gay rumors? Check out our list:</p><h2 id=john-travolta><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>John Travolta</span></h2><p>For years now, John Travolta has had to deal with constant rumors that he is gay. Moreover, the rumors further gained traction after an ex-pilot in Travolta’s airline company accused the actor of battery.</p><p>Speaking to the Daily Beast following the death of his son, Travolta said he found the rumors “most offensive.” He further remarked, “Sex stuff is always going to be interesting to somebody, but you stay away from family. You really should.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kenny-chesney><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Kenny Chesney</span></h2><p>Rumors about country singer Kenny Chesney spread like wildfire following his split from actress Renee Zellweger back in 2005. Many referred to the fact that “fraud” was cited as a reason for the divorce.</p><p>However, during an aired interview on “60 Minutes” with Anderson Cooper, Chesney responded to the rumors saying, “Maybe I should have come out and said ‘No I’m not,’ but I didn’t want to draw any more attention to it.”</p><h2 id=tom-cruise><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Tom Cruise</span></h2><p>Despite dating several women in Hollywood, there is still some speculation that actor Tom Cruise is gay. When these rumors swirled, former mobster Johnny Fratto decided to defend Cruise after working with the actor in “The Colour of Money.”</p><p>According to The Telegraph, Fratto wrote in his biography, “Despite what rumors you've heard, I can vouch from firsthand experience that Tom Cruise is not a homosexual.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jared-leto><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Jared Leto</span></h2><p>Perhaps, rumors have swirled about Leto’s sexuality due to the fact that he didn’t shy away from portraying controversial roles. This was the case when he played a transgender woman in “The Dallas Buyers Club.” Moreover, Alexis Arquette once claimed that she slept with Leto while he was still a man.</p><p>However, by all accounts, Leto is straight. In fact, W Magazine refers to him as an “eccentric bachelor” who has been linked to Cameron Diaz, Scarlett Johansson, Ashley Olsen, Paris Hilton, and Lindsay Lohan.</p><h2 id=taylor-lautner><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Taylor Lautner</span></h2><p>Back in 2011, millions of Taylor Lautner fans were surprised when the actor appeared on a People magazine cover in which he was coming out as gay.</p><p>However, this cover turned out to be fake. And when he was later asked by GQ Australia about being hit on by openly gay director Gus Van Sant and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, Lautner replied, “No, definitely not. I think they know I’m straight. But they’re great guys. They’re a lot of fun.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=whoopi-goldberg><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Whoopi Goldberg</span></h2><p>Now, actress and television host Whoopi Goldberg may be loud and opinionated, but she is certainly not gay despite the rumors.</p><p>During an interview with Pride Source, Goldberg playfully remarked, “You’ve never seen me with a woman. Pretty much been married to men the whooole time! Not the same, but a few of them. (Laughs) Nah, I’m straight, but what does it mean?.”</p><h2 id=dolly-parton><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Dolly Parton</span></h2><p>Country music icon Dolly Parton is a proud supporter of the LGBT community. However, she would also like to set the record straight, amidst rumors that she is romantically involved with her best friend Judy Ogle.</p><p>During an interview with Pride Source, Parton remarked, “I am not gay, but if I were I would be the first one running out of the closet.”</p><h2 id=mariah-carey><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Mariah Carey</span></h2><p>Mariah Carey is another hit singer that seems to have been dealing with gay speculation over the years. This may be because she has a lot of following in the gay community.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During a 2010 interview with Advocate, Carey was confronted about these rumors and she remarked, “If it makes somebody happy to say that, then whatever, but that’s not the reality.”</p><h2 id=hayden-christensen><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Hayden Christensen</span></h2><p>Amidst rumors that he is a homosexual, ‘Star Wars’ actor Hayden Christensen told news organization WENN, “It's hilarious. I'm not gay. It's amazing how much people will speculate if they haven't actual information to draw from--they just make up whatever they feel is appropriate. That's cool. As long as the people I know and care about know the truth, then everyone else's opinion doesn't really matter.”</p><h2 id=alicia-keys><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Alicia Keys</span></h2><p>Grammy-winning artist Alicia Keys has had to put up with gay rumors possibly brought on by some of the lyrics to her songs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an interview with People in 2003, Keys was asked about being a lesbian and the singer replied, “I absolutely am not.” She further remarked, “I think what happens is any person that grazes any TV set is gay. I don’t know what it is — it’s like you have to be gay to be on a TV show.”</p><h2 id=chris-pine><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Chris Pine</span></h2><p>Despite playing Wonder Woman’s leading man recently, Chris Pine is an actor who is still surrounded by gay rumors. This might be due to the fact that he has voiced out support for “Star Trek Beyond” having an openly gay character.</p><p>Moreover, he has also been supportive of his “Star Trek” co-star eventually coming out. However, Pine is not gay himself. For some time now, the actor has been dating Annabelle Wallis.</p><h2 id=bruno-mars><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Bruno Mars</span></h2><p>Bruno Mars is a singer who is known for heart-stopping performances onstage. Back in 2016, a rumor emanated from a CNN iReport via a citizen journalist that the singer had come out about his sexuality during an interview with a radio station.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In response, Mars' representatives said that the claim is “completely false.”</p><h2 id=tom-hardy><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Tom Hardy</span></h2><p>Tom Hardy is an actor known for his roles in action films and romantic comedies. Nonetheless, speculation rose about his sexuality following an interview in which Hardy claims to have been misquoted.</p><p>Since then, he’s done an interview with Entertainment Weekly where he said, “Should I come out of the closet when I’m not in one?”</p><h2 id=george-clooney><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>George Clooney</span></h2><p>Actor George Clooney has always been dashing and absolutely bankable. However, despite being married to a gorgeous human rights lawyer and having twins recently, there is still some speculation that Clooney is gay.</p><p>During an interview with The Advocate, Clooney also mentioned that the only reason he doesn’t want to formally deny being gay is that he doesn’t want to “make it seem like being gay is a bad thing.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oprah-winfrey><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Oprah Winfrey</span></h2><p>Talk show host turned network mogul Oprah Winfrey has always been plagued gay rumors throughout her career. This is mainly because there are some who insists that she and her gal pal Gayle King are more than close friends.</p><p>During a 2012 interview with Barbara Walters, the subject did come up and Winfrey simply described King as “the mother I never had.” Today, she continues to be in a relationship with longtime boyfriend Stedman Graham.</p><h2 id=kate-hudson><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kate Hudson</span></h2><p>Believe it or not, actress Kate Hudson has had to deal with rumors that she is a lesbian throughout her career. Back in 2009, she finally decided to set the record straight.</p><p>According to a report from E! News, Hudson said, “I was in Miami and a girlfriend of mine called me and goes, 'Are you making out with girls?' I was like, 'What are you talking about?' But no, no, no—strictly boys for me!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jeremy-renner><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jeremy Renner</span></h2><p>Marvel Cinematic Universe actor Jeremy Renner is certainly no stranger to gay rumors. In 2012, he decided to address this issue during an interview with Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>In what appears like vehement denial, Renner explained, “I want my personal life to be personal, and it’s not true. And I don’t care if you’re talking about things that are true, you’re still talking about my personal life.”</p><h2 id=zoe-saldana><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Zoe Saldana</span></h2><p>‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ actress Zoe Saldana may have sparked speculation about her sexuality during an interview with Allure.</p><p>However, she has since clarified the issues, telling BET, “Up until now, I’ve known my life to be with men. I’ve been attracted to the male species.” Furthermore, she also remarked, “It’s the saddest situation... It is almost impossible for us to get through one conversation with somebody at a cashier without having to go, ‘Oh is she Mexican? Oh is she gay?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-clarkson><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kelly Clarkson</span></h2><p>Grammy-winning singer Kelly Clarkson once said she’s had to deal with lesbian rumors in her hometown because people thought that’s why she didn’t settle down at a younger age.</p><p>During an interview with Cosmopolitan, Clarkson remarked, “That’s kind of an insult to the gay community. Being single doesn’t mean you’re gay. But I’m never insulted by it, obviously. I mean, I get hit on by the hottest girls ever. Oh, my god, if I were a lesbian, I would be so in luck. But it’s just not my thing.”</p><h2 id=zac-efron><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Zac Efron</span></h2><p>Despite all his shirtless photos and movie scenes, it seems actor Zac Efron still can’t distance himself enough from gay rumors. It might be because Dave and James Franco like to joke about him and that subject.</p><p>Despite this, Efron has been rumored to be dating several women over the years. Most recently, Cosmopolitan reported that Efron is possibly dating actress Lily Collins at the moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources - Daily Beast, 60 Minutes, Pride Source, Cosmopolitan, Advocate & E!
