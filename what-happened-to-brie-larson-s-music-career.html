Her journey from indie films to winning an Academy Award for Best Actress showcases her remarkable talent and dedication to her craft. Beyond acting, Larson has also ventured into the world of music, adding another dimension to her multifaceted career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brie Larson's acting career began at a young age, with her first television appearance in 1998. Over the years, she honed her skills through various television roles, eventually transitioning to the big screen. Her breakthrough came with the critically acclaimed drama Short Term 12, where she played the role of a supervisor at a foster care facility.</p><p>However, it was her portrayal of Joy "Ma" Newsome in the film Room that catapulted her to international stardom. Her remarkable performance earned her numerous awards.</p><p>Larson continued to take on diverse roles, from the superheroine Carol Danvers in Captain Marvel (2019) to her portrayal of Mason Weaver in Kong: Skull Island. Her time as Carol Danvers has landed her in some of the highest-grossing movies of all time, including Avengers: Endgame.</p><p>Most people will know Brie best as an actress, but few know that she tried her hand at a music career before fully breaking out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-Is-Brie-Larson-Getting-Ripped-For-Captain-Marvel-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Truth About Brie Larson's Alleged &#34;Diva-Like Behavior&#34; And If It Actually Delayed Marvel's Phase 5 ">The Truth About Brie Larson's Alleged "Diva-Like Behavior" And If It Actually Delayed Marvel's Phase 5</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>What did Brie Larson say about these controversial comments directed at her attitude on set of MCU's The Marvels?</p><h2 id=her-music-career-failed-to-take-off-and-was-put-on-hold>Her Music Career Failed To Take Off, And Was Put On Hold</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brie-Larson-guitar.jpg><p>In 2005, Brie Larson, at the age of 16, unveiled her musical talents by releasing her debut album, Finally Out of P.E., under the record label Casablanca. The album showcased her as a pop-rock artist with a youthful, catchy sound. The songs often revolved around themes related to teenage experiences, making it relatable to her peers at the time.</p><p>Critics' opinions on the album were mixed, reflecting the challenges that often accompany a career shift. While some praised her vocal abilities and the album's catchy tunes, others were more reserved in their judgment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview</a>, Larson said, "I think that I write about stuff that others don't write about. I don't have a bunch of love songs cuz I don't really have much boy experience. I just write about what I am actually going through in my real life. That's where the title from my album comes from - Finally out of P.E. My P.E. teacher didn't like me at all, which was hard to deal with cuz I was usually such a teachers' pet. So when I found out I got my record deal, I was like, 'Yes, I'm finally out of P.E.'"</p><p>After her lone album, Larson has flashed her musical abilities at times, but has seemingly left the music industry behind.</p><p>Larson is not a major force in music at this stage of her career, but she is a big name in acting. In fact, the actress has a few major projects on deck, and fans cannot wait to see them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brie-larson-hollywood-career-completely-took-off-to-a-list-status>Brie Larson Hollywood Career Completely Took Off To A-List Status</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/brie-larson-in-captain-marvel-1.jpg><p>The biggest project that Brie Larson has on deck is The Marvels, which is set for release later this year. It is the sequel to her billion-dollar blockbuster, Captain Marvel, and it's set to push the MCU forward in Phase 5.</p><p>Larson's veteran Carol Danvers will be working with some new friends, including Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan.</p><p>"Iman is the future. She is the perfect Ms. Marvel and the most incredible person and castmate. I'm so excited for her success and I'm so excited to see what she will do with her life because she can do anything she wants.
