Saying goodbye was a bold decision given that Jerry was offered over $100 million to continue on for an extra season. Jerry got the last laugh nonetheless, as he was able to pocket a fortune alongside Larry David for syndication rights.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nonetheless, according to Jerry, a major part of his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">success has to do with timing more than anything else</a>.</p><p>He revealed, “I have to say, I have a sense of timing. I have it in jokes, I have it in my sets, I have it in my career. I knew when to move to L.A. I knew when I was ready for ‘The Tonight Show.’ I knew when I was ready to do something bigger like the sitcom. I just knew. And I knew that was our moment.”</p><p>Jerry continues with Howard Stern, “I could not go to that point where it starts to age and whither — and it doesn’t take long,” Seinfeld said. “Too much cake, too much anything — it changes the whole feeling.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Larry David Had A Strict Rule For The Live Audience To Follow During The Filming Of Seinfeld</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given his insane net worth and love for the New York Mets, Jerry has been closely aligned to the team for years, especially in the midst of their ownership troubles.

Nonetheless, fans had linked Seinfeld to his next potential gig, which involved the New York Mets.</p><p>When asked about his potential involvement with TMZ, Jerry was quick to deny the reports. He briefly touched on A-Rod potentially owning the team at the time, while revealing that he was more interested in being a fan than an owner.</p><p>"No! The highest level of sports appreciation—particularly baseball—is a hot dog, a beer and a seat," Seinfeld said. "There's nothing higher.

Of course, Jerry's success all started as a comedian, and would later change into so much more. Looking back at some of the most valuable lessons learned, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry credits his unwillingness to find comfort in the field</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He revealed, "If you make music, you know what I'm talking about. If you get up to perform that song — even if you've got a perfect recorded version of it — I'm sure at times you get up to perform it in front of an audience? Well, that's going to go a certain way, and most likely, you're going to go, "It wasn't quite as good as I wanted it to be."</p><p>He continues "And sometimes it'll be better than the recorded version and that kills you too. You think, "Gee, I wish I had that on tape." And so that's the pain of it. But it's so much a part of human existence in general."</p><p>Being his own worst critic proved to be a driving force for Jerry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdn7Kzvthmqp6hnpuyrbCMramyZaSkeqPB2GaroZ1do7K4edioqaRlnZrBtHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gerado-mejia-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gerado Mejia Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./did-bruce-willis-and-demi-moore-actually-stay-on-good-terms-post-divorce.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Did Bruce Willis And Demi Moore Actually Stay On Good Terms Post-Divorce?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
