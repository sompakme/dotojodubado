The Voice coach revealed that it won’t be long before he takes a step back from the limelight. Shelton did not directly say that he would be quitting The Voice, but stepping back from his career means it’s one of the things that he would have to give up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shelton also said that he’s looking forward to having a quieter and simpler life with his fiancée, Gwen Stefani. Reports revealed that the couple will tie the knot this year.</p><p>“I mean, we’ve both pretty much taken it to the limit as far as our careers go and touring and now the television thing. It’s been fortunate to accomplish a lot of things. But, hopefully, at some point, we get a chance to live some life,” he said.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Blake Shelton Net Worth</a></span></p><p>According to <a href=#>Good Housekeeping</a>, Shelton potentially leaving The Voice will be a great loss for the show and for NBC. After all, the country crooner is the last original coach left on the reality TV show. Adam Levine left The Voice after Season 16.</p><p>However, the loss won’t only be felt by the producers and the network where The Voice air. Shelton himself will feel the loss because quitting the show means <a href=#>he would be losing his $26 million income annually</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since The Voice airs two seasons per year, Shelton earns $13 million at the end of each other. This salary is much higher than what he used to get from the show. During the early seasons, he only earned $2 million per cycle or $4 million annually.</p><p>And quitting his music career altogether means losing an even bigger chunk of Shelton’s <a href=#>$100 million net worth</a>. The singer’s salary comes from The Voice, his albums, endorsements, and appearances.</p><p>Shelton has also sold 10 million albums worldwide and 35 million singles. The singer’s songs have also generated billions of digital streams.</p><p>Some of his hit songs include “Hillbilly Bone,” “If I’m Honest,” “Based on A True Story,” “Bringing Back the Sunshine,” and “She Wouldn’t Be Gone.”</p><p>Shelton may also be stepping back on his decades-long career because he wants to <a href=#>focus on the life that he’s building with Stefani</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Last month, the country artist confirmed to Kotb that <a href=#>he and Stefani will tie the knot very soon</a>. In fact, it is possible that the A-listers will wed before Kotb ties the knot either in the summer or in the fall.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton Can't Afford Adam Levine As A Wedding Singer</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=#>Good Housekeeping</a>, <a href=#>Talent Recap</a>, <a href=#>Today</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSvra3KnmSsoJWhwbC6jK%2BmopuVYrK5tdNo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bobby-kotick-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bobby Kotick Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adrian-peterson-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Adrian Peterson Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
