But as any other prestigious actor in Hollywood, Cruise started small and steadily worked his way up the ladder, earning weightier paychecks as his stature grew in the entertainment industry.

For most ultra rich celebrities, it's more manageable to invest their millions into things like properties and stocks in larger companies because they often yield a greater return on their investment.
