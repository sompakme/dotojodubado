He died at the age of 50 at his home in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, California. The cause of death was acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication, and his death was ruled a homicide. Dr. Conrad Murray, Michael Jackson's personal physician, was later convicted of involuntary manslaughter for administering the drugs that led to Jackson's death.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Jackson left his estate to his three children - Prince, Paris, and Blanket - he did set up a separate trust named The Katherine Jackson Trust to care for his mother, Katherine, throughout her life.</p><p>John Branca and John McClain were appointed executors of Michael's estate (and thus the money set aside for Katherine) and claim to have made hundreds of millions for Jackson’s legacy through various deals. Last year, they sought court approval for a confidential, reportedly lucrative deal, which Katherine opposed in a heavily redacted response. While the court eventually dismissed her objections, Katherine is continuing to appeal the decision. The $560,000 she wants from Michael’s estate is to cover legal expenses related to fighting the executors. Her appeal as well as the new motion remain ongoing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqGTna6muIyjmJyjo6S7tHnMqKRmbWZlfXF8jJ6qrZmkmnqntcahq6xlla2ypMHTqKmsZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nick-candy-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nick Candy Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mel-gibson-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mel Gibson Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
