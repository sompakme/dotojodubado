Even diehard fans would not resist the latest gossip concerning their favorite idols, because such information usually sounds so sweet, only because it concerns a famous person. Some shows on TV and blogs run on nothing but celebrity gossip, and such media attracts millions of viewers and readers every day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Therefore, nearly all celebrities have to hide, almost every minute they are going shopping, spending time with their loved ones, or doing any normal thing all of us do every day. If celebrities have to hide to do these things, can you imagine the lengths they have to go to protect themselves when doing things they or others consider wrong?</p><p>However, since most people would give anything to become rich and famous, the invasion of privacy seems like nothing compared to the advantages that come with becoming a celebrity. However, some people have become famous simply because they are famous, not because they are good actors, musicians, or entrepreneurs. These socialites do all they can to attract attention, including releasing indecent tapes and images of themselves online.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here is a list of celebrities, most of whom are living a gay lifestyle today, who did not want people finding out about their sexual orientation and at one point in time did everything they could to hide it. Those who came out no longer want to hide their past gay experiences since they freely talk about them, but the others prefer to let the known experiences remain in the past.</p><h2 id=kerry-rhodes><strong>Kerry Rhodes</strong></h2><p>How familiar are you with Kerry Rhodes? If you love football, then you know he used to be one of the Arizona Cardinals hardest hitters between 2010 and 2012. The Cardinals released him in 2013, and although some sources claimed the NFL blacklisted him, he confirmed he wasn't playing anymore because he wanted to pursue other interests including acting and producing.</p><p>If you look up Kerry Rhodes online, you will discover he is married to Nicky Whelan, an Australian actress who he got engaged to in 2016 and married this year in April. This, of course, means he is straight, and if you ask him he will undoubtedly say he is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, he is on this list because, in 2013, Russell Simpson claimed the two were a couple, and the numerous photos of the two of them on vacation proved something was going on. Russell also shared text messages between him and Rhodes, proving something was definitely going on between these two. This alleged gay past is something Rhodes tried to hide and has completely moved on because he married Nicky.</p><h2 id=michelle-rodriguez><strong>Michelle Rodriguez&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle Rodriguez</a> is undoubtedly one of the most successful Latina actresses in Hollywood, owing to her portrayal of Letty, one of the stars of The Fast and the Furious, as well as her role as Ana Lucia Cortez on Lost. Other successful films she has been part of include Avatar, Resident Evil, and S.W.A.T., among others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When she was at the premiere of the film Battle: Los Angeles in 2011, she responded to a question about her being a lesbian by claiming she was not, and that she likes "sausage." Earlier in 2007 when Curve magazine claimed she was out, she wrote on her website how such exposure might hurt her young career then and how she only liked men, "real ones anyway."</p><p>However, in 2013, Michelle came out as a bisexual. In 2016 she said how her curiosity led her to go both ways and was intrigued by both men and women.</p><h2 id=tom-daley><strong>Tom Daley</strong></h2><p>If you are a fan of diving, especially on the international scene, then you are most definitely familiar with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas Daley</a>. Daley is a FINA World Champion, a 10-meter platform event specialist, and a Plymouth Diving Club member who started diving at seven years and made a national and international impact when he was just nine years. At the 2010 Commonwealth Games he won two gold medals, he won a bronze medal at the Summer Olympic Games in 2012, and a bronze medal at the Summer Olympic Games in 2016 in the synchronized 10-meter platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In September 2013, he told The Mirror he found it funny when people claimed he was gay and would laugh it off. It was actually something he was bullied about while in school. He continued to claim he wouldn't be ashamed if he were gay, but as it turns out, he was actually gay. A few months after the interview with The Mirror he came out as gay and he is now married to Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black.</p><h2 id=portia-de-rossi><strong>Portia de Rossi&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Portia de Rossi</a> was born in Australia and gained United States citizenship in 2011, following her marriage to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellen DeGeneres</a> in 2008. If you were a fan of Scandal, you remember her as Elizabeth North, although her role as Nelle Porter on Ally McBeal was unforgettable, since she even won a Screen Actors Guild Award for it back in 1999.</p><p>Although she is married to a woman and is openly gay, a few years back she would have done anything to hide it. When she was on Ally McBeal, between 1997 and 2002, she faced her toughest time trying to hide her sexuality, since she tried not to date anyone at the time until she had saved enough to afford a more private life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During this time she battled eating disorders, which she described&nbsp;as a lover who never left her. However, after she came out in 2005, she didn't feel the need to hide her past anymore.</p><h2 id=wentworth-miller><strong>Wentworth Miller</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wentworth Miller</a>, who most people know as Michael Scofield, is a great actor whose leading role in Prison Break made him famous the world over. His acting in Prison Break earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role and many other award nominations, but he took home the 2015 Saturn Award for Best Guest Starring Role on Television for his role as Leonard Snart/Captain Cold on The Flash.</p><p>Miller is on this list because people questioned his sexuality during the days he was playing the role of Scofield, but in 2007 he completely denied being gay, claiming those were just rumors. He continued to state how people's fantasies of who they imagined him with shouldn't affect how religiously they watch the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, in 2013, Miller wrote a letter to reject an invitation to the St. Petersburg Film Festival, claiming he cannot participate in celebrations in a country where gay people like himself were denied rights to live and love openly.</p><h2 id=clay-aiken><strong>Clay Aiken</strong></h2><p>It seems as though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clay Aiken</a> has tried everything since he is a singer, songwriter, actor, TV personality, activist, politician, and author. He came in second on 2003's American Idol and has released at least five albums to date. He has made a number of appearances as a guest on talk shows including Jimmy Kimmel Live and The Tonight Show, as well as in shows such as Drop Dead Diva, 30 Rock, and Scrubs.</p><p>He was a UNICEF Ambassador of Education for All Children Worldwide, a role he played for nine and a half years, giving it up only when he joined politics. In 2014, he ran for congress in North Carolina's 2nd congressional district on the Democratic Party ticket but lost the seat to a Republican.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 2003, he was asked about his sexuality and denied being gay, claiming how people get to the public eye and everyone begins thinking they are either womanizers or gay, which he clearly stated he was neither. However, in 2008, he officially came out as gay.</p><h2 id=ian-thorpe><strong>Ian Thorpe</strong></h2><p>From 1999 to 2003, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian Thorpe</a> was without a doubt one of the best swimmers in the world, and he has numerous awards and medals to prove it. This Australian specialized in freestyle and backstroke, and he won five Olympic gold medals for Australia back in those days. In the 2000 Summer Olympics, his three gold and two silver medals made him the most successful athlete in the event.</p><p>In total, Thorpe won 11 World Championship gold medals, meaning only two other swimmers have more medals than him in history. For five consecutive years since 1999, Thorpe was Australian Swimmer of the Year, making him one of the most popular athletes in Australia. Although he has tried to get back to swimming on several occasions, he isn't competing anymore owing to illnesses and injuries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thorpe wrote a book in 2012, This is Me and therein claimed how hurtful the rumors of him being gay were because he was not. However, two years later, he revealed he was gay, claiming the rumors had in fact turned out to be true.</p><h2 id=michael-stipe><strong>Michael Stipe</strong></h2><p>Any fan of the group R.E.M must be very familiar with Michael Stripe, who was the group's lead singer and lyricist. R.E.M was one of the first alternative rock bands formed in 1980 by lead vocalist Michael Stipe, bassist/backing vocalist Mike Mills, guitarist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter Buck</a>, and drummer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Berry</a>. This band was special for their&nbsp;obscure lyrics, Buck's guitar style, Mill's melodic bass line, backup vocals, and of course, Stipe's unique vocal quality.</p><p>Stripe was also in charge of the band's visual aspect, directing the videos, and even selecting their album's artwork. Stripe undoubtedly influenced numerous artists such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kurt Cobain</a>, with others such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bono</a> describing his voice as one of the most extraordinary in the industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout his career, people questioned Stripe, asking him whether he was bisexual or gay and he refused to comment on the issue, preferring to keep his personal life private. However, in 2008, he came out as gay, claiming how his opening up could help others struggling out there.</p><h2 id=raven-symon><strong>Raven-Symon√©</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raven- Symon√©</a> is an actress, producer, TV personality, singer, and songwriter. She started acting when she was just four years old, appearing on The Cosby Show, later on in Hangin' with Mr. Cooper, and even in the film The Muppets at Walt Disney World, and many other appearances. Her most notable role was her hit Disney show That's So Raven.&nbsp;Although these days she is doing a lot of voice roles, she has&nbsp;the upcoming Raven&nbsp;reboot&nbsp;Raven's Home&nbsp;in the works, and has appeared in the hit shows Empire and Blackish.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When she appeared on Oprah: Where Are They Now?&nbsp;she&nbsp;tried clarifying her sexual orientation by claiming she wasn't gay and disliked labels. She continued to explain how she knew she was interested in women at an early age, and how she referred to herself as a human who loves humans.</p><p>She got into a relationship with AzMarie Livingston for a while but it didn't work out, and throughout she tried to keep her personal life private. However, in 2016, while on The View, she said she was a lesbian, thereby clarifying her orientation.</p><h2 id=kevin-spacey><strong>Kevin Spacey&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Spacey</a> appears to be a very successful actor, having won at least one Golden Globe Award and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. However, for people who include a spouse and children in their definition of success, Spacey is still not successful. It seems as if Spacey has made it one of his life's goals to make his personal life as private as possible because, at 57 years of age, we aren't aware of him having a wife or children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spacey has had an outstanding acting career, with some of his most notable appearances being in the films, Seven, Pay It Forward, Superman Returns, and of course his role as Frank Underwood on House of Cards.</p><p>Spacey is on this list because he has always denied rumors surrounding his sexual orientation, especially those claiming he is gay. However, in 2014 images of him and a male model touching, cuddling, massaging, and stroking each other behind some rocks during the day seemed to suggest something about his orientation.</p><h2 id=chely-wright><strong>Chely Wright</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chely Wright</a> is a country music singer who achieved great success as soon as she began her career between 1994 and 1995 when she was considered Top New Female Vocalist by the Academy of Country Music (ACM). In 1997, her hit song "Shut Up and Drive" was her first Top 40 country hit and got her first number one single&nbsp;"Single White Female" from her fourth album. Wright has at least eight albums and over 15 singles making it to the country charts and had sold over 1.5 million copies in the United States alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When she came out in 2010, she was possibly the first country musician to come out as a lesbian, and she did so on TV and in her autobiography. She claimed the reason for coming out in public was out of concern for homosexual teenagers who were being bullied. She further explained how her lying and hiding had caused considerable damage to her own life, the reason she also makes it to this list.</p><h2 id=ricky-martin><strong>Ricky Martin</strong></h2><p>Ricky Martin, whose real name is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Enrique Martin Morales</a>, is a singer, actor, and author from Puerto Rico, who began his music career at 12 years of age when he was part of a group called Menudo. He made and produced a number of albums on his own throughout the 90s, in addition to acting and thereby becoming famous to some extent.</p><p>Ricky Martin is credited for introducing Latin pop to the U.S music scene, after performing "The Cup of Life" at the Grammy Awards. The&nbsp;release of his single "Livin' La Vida Loca" made him a worldwide celebrity, as well as a sex symbol.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Almost 17 years ago Ricky claimed the rumors surrounding him being gay were being spread by people who don‚Äôt have a life or those who wanted him to be like them and refuted those claims. However, a decade after trying to hide, he came out, saying he was a fortunate homosexual man. He got into a relationship with Carlos Gonz√°lez Abella in 2011 but they broke up in 2014 and he is now engaged to Jwan Yosef, a Syrian Swedish painter. The singer also has two sons.</p><h2 id=tracy-chapman><strong>Tracy Chapman</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracy Chapman</a> is a multi-platinum and Grammy Award-winning artist and has many studio albums. Some of the songs we know and love her for include hits such as "Give Me One Reason" and "Fast Car" among others. Her first album Tracy Chapman was a multi-platinum worldwide hit, garnering her six Grammy nominations, from which she won three. Her fourth Grammy was as a result of "New Beginning," which won the Best Rock Song.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chapman is on this list because of a relationship she had with author Alice Walker. Although this relationship was in the mid-1990s, she has done so well keeping her relationships and personal matters private. Although some sources claim she is an advocate for the LGBT&nbsp;community and a proud lesbian, she makes it her priority to never disclose her sexual orientation. She keeps reminding the public that her public life is her work, but her private life is hers and she does her best to keep the two separate.</p><h2 id=lucas-cruikshank><strong>Lucas Cruikshank</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucas Cruikshank</a> is a YouTube personality and an actor, who most people recognize as the creator of Fred Figglehorn, a fictional character who has appeared on his channel since 2005. This high-pitched character is six years old; he comes from a dysfunctional home and has anger management issues, a combination of traits that make him so interesting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So far, there have been three Fred films, Fred: The Movie (2010), Fred 2: Night of the Living Fred (2011), and Fred 3: Camp Fred (2012). In 2009, Lucas won the Teen Choice Award for the Choice Web Star category and has other award nominations in relation to his work.</p><p>With regard to his appearance on this list, in the video Joey Graceffa (who we'll talk more about later) posted revealing he was gay, Lucas also confirmed he was gay and went further to explain how he had denied being gay for so long. Over the years he had dated numerous girls to the point where everyone believed he was straight, but he just couldn't deny it anymore.</p><h2 id=joey-graceffa><strong>Joey Graceffa</strong></h2><p>Joey Graceffa is a YouTube personality whose videos have a combined viewership of over 1.7 billion views. In addition, he is a singer, producer, author, and an actor. He uses one of his channels for video gaming, and the other one for vlogging. He participated in the 22nd and 24th seasons of The Amazing Race and&nbsp;has appeared in at least seven films and several other web films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Joey doesn't receive as much media attention as Hollywood celebrities, it seems as though very soon his niche of entertainment will reach the levels of film and TV stars and his personal life will no longer be private. In one of his videos on YouTube, he claimed his family suspected he was gay when he was young, as young as in the eighth grade, and when they asked him about it, he strongly claimed to be straight. Over the years he kept claiming he liked girls, but when he got to 25 years old, he finally came out as gay.</p><p><strong>Sources: </strong>eonline.com, gawker.com, afterellen.com, bossip.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2Ysq2xwaxksKCfYsGztcSdZK2nXZ22pbGMrZ%2BeoaJitKLFjKmYrKxf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./8-of-taylor-swift-s-most-iconic-looks.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>8 Of Taylor Swift's Most Iconic Looks</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./travis-kelce-doesn-t-know-if-he-will-play-in-sunday-s-chiefs-game.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Travis Kelce Doesn't Know If He Will Play in Sunday's Chiefs Game</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
