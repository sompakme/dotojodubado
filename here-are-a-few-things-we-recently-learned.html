The life and career of Charlotte each make her one of the most fascinating figures in the industry today. Fans love to learn more about her and that certainly has become more common during her rise to the top.

The on-screen explanation of Charlotte requesting the match was the real explanation behind the match getting booked. Flair kept a friendship with Yim since they faced off in Charlotte’s first-ever televised match to start her NXT career.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>14 Charlotte Photos The Flair Family Might Not Approve Of</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nxt-title-win-was-done-to-help-ratings-vs-aew><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>NXT title win was done to help ratings vs AEW</span></h2><p>Reports following WrestleMania 36 saw NXT’s ratings playing a strong role in Charlotte Flair defeating <a href=#>Rhea Ripley</a> for the NXT Women’s Championship. WWE wants to improve NXT’s viewership to outperform AEW when the shows return to normal with live crowds. Charlotte’s name value and star power in WWE played a huge role in the decision.</p><h2 id=has-next-dream-match-goal-vs-beth-phoenix><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Has next dream match goal vs Beth Phoenix</span></h2><p>Charlotte Flair received her dream match against <a href=#>Trish Stratus</a> at Summerslam 2019 and delivered a great performance. Interviews and social media posts have indicated Charlotte’s next dream match would be against NXT commentator Beth Phoenix. WWE could easily opt for it in NXT since both are part of the weekly product.</p><h2 id=filed-trademark-with-andrade-in-case-they-leave-wwe><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Filed trademark with Andrade in case they leave WWE</span></h2><p>Andrade and Charlotte Flair <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made headlines when claiming a few copyrights</a> for their future. WWE owns the names of most talents, including the couple. Charlotte trademarked “Ashley Flair” and “The Queen of Wrestling” with Andrade doing the same for “El Idolo” and “La Sombra.” Both wrestlers are likely sticking with WWE in the long run, but this sets up them in case a future in other promotions exists.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wwe-still-views-her-as-top-star><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>WWE still views her as top star</span></h2><p>The booking of Charlotte Flair in late 2019 made her an afterthought for the first time in many years. WWE reminded the wrestling world of her value with the 2020 Royal Rumble women’s match victory. Charlotte getting such a spotlight during WrestleMania season indicated she’s right there with Becky Lynch, Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins as the top stars.</p><h2 id=enjoyed-empty-venue-shows><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Enjoyed empty venue shows</span></h2><p>Charlotte Flair was one of the few wrestlers to claim the empty arena aspect of WrestleMania 36 helped her out. The lack of crowd interaction was tough, but Charlotte stated she was more locked in than usual. Rhea Ripley and Charlotte had a great match that led to the major title change.</p><h2 id=playing-neutral-character-in-nxt><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Playing neutral character in NXT</span></h2><p>The main roster heel character of Charlotte Flair is generally the same in NXT, but that doesn’t mean she’s only wrestling faces. Flair is already advertised to feud with NXT’s top female heel Io Shirai. WWE just wants to have all the major matches for Charlotte during this run since she’s likely leaving NXT whenever she drops the title.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=underpaid-compared-to-other-top-stars><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Underpaid compared to other top stars</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWE’s top ten highest salaries</a> getting released surprised many fans that Charlotte Flair was not on the list. Becky Lynch was the only female wrestler to crack the top ten by making $3.1 million. Charlotte is reportedly making a downside of $1 million, That figure is clearly wonderful, but there is no reason she should be making less than Braun Strowman or one fourth as much as Seth Rollins.</p><h2 id=was-upset-about-ric-flair-threatening-to-sue-wwe><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Was upset about Ric Flair threatening to sue WWE</span></h2><p>Ric Flair reportedly upset Charlotte Flair when making controversial comments about Becky Lynch and WWE. The use of “The Man” by Lynch saw <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ric publicly threatening a lawsuit</a> while claiming WWE disrespects him by using his old moniker. Charlotte’s anger was enough for Ric to avoid going through with the lawsuit.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>19 Sketchy Facts About The Flair Family</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=watches-aew><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Watches AEW</span></h2><p>WWE wrestlers often attempt to avoid discussing AEW since they are technically competing against each other. However, Charlotte Flair was one of a few WWE stars watching AEW’s debut Double or Nothing show in 2019. The Twitter likes from Charlotte showed a few comments of her agreeing with others enjoying the show. Charlotte seems to be a WWE lifer, but another thriving mainstream company is good news for all wrestlers.</p><h2 id=feels-there-is-a-real-competition-with-becky-lynch><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Feels there is a real competition with Becky Lynch</span></h2><p>The friendship between <a href=#>Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair</a> saw them introduced as best friends on the main roster. Lynch unfortunately started to get viewed as Charlotte’s sidekick until her 2018 character shift. Charlotte appeared on The Herd with Colin Cowherd and referenced her competition with Becky. Both ladies are fighting for the top spot with mutual respect much like Steve Austin and The Rock in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wwe-wants-her-to-break-ric-s-record><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>WWE wants her to break Ric's record</span></h2><p>WWE’s booking of Charlotte Flair has shown some of the strangest short title reigns. Charlotte held the Smackdown Women’s Championship for a few hours and a few days each in 2019 before losing to Bayley both times. The weak title reigns were done intentionally to get Charlotte up to ten Women’s Championship reigns and another two if NXT ever counts. WWE is clearly grooming Charlotte to match or top her dad Ric’s 16 world title runs.</p><h2 id=wwe-puts-andrade-on-same-show-to-keep-her-happy><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>WWE puts Andrade on same show to keep her happy</span></h2><p>Couples in WWE are not guaranteed to work together if WWE feels they are better off on different shows. Charlotte Flair is important enough to have her relationship with Andrade factored in more often. WWE moved Andrade to Smackdown in the past to keep him on the same brand as Charlotte. The two ended up on Raw together again following the late 2019 draft.</p><p>Sources: Ringside News & Forbes</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Evolution Of Charlotte Flair In 15 Photos</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoZmioby1wMRmnaWZmad6qbHRnmSaqpVirm6yxLBkraCZo7S0edaeZKudk5q7tbjYZqOemaKjsqV7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lady-gabriella-windsor-s-luisa-beccaria-wedding-dress-pics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lady Gabriella Windsor's Luisa Beccaria Wedding Dress: Pics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alexa-bliss-believes-her-match-with-ronda-rousey-can-headline-summerslam.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alexa Bliss Believes Her Match With Ronda Rousey Can Headline SummerSlam</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
