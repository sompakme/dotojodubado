Just 40 pounds of fat now gone from my body, but wow, it's pretty much all I get asked about. In the last year, I got to star in a movie, wrote and directed my next one, and adopted a three year old from American Foster Care. But guess what I'm asked- how did I lose the weight?" the My Life in Ruins actress, 46, writes on CNN's <a href=# rel=noopener>AC360 Blog</a>.</p><p>Check out pics of scary skinny stars.</p><p>"I am embarrassed to be in the position of answering questions about my body again. On the publicity tour of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, I was asked over and over again, if, as the writer, I felt it was a fair depiction of real life to have someone of my er, below average looks, hook up with hottie <strong>John Corbett</strong>.</p><p>See photos of celebs who went from hunk to chunk.</p><p>"It's been years, and I have sat through many a movie like Sideways, where nobody blinks an eye when <strong>Paul Giamatti</strong> gets together with gorgeous <strong>Virginia Madsen</strong>. And, then Knocked Up…well, the visual of <strong>Seth Rogan</strong> on top of <strong>Katherine Heigl</strong> made me put the popcorn down and reach for my <a href=# data-link=1>purse</a>. Not because I was grossed out, but because I knew the film was about to stop and <strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong> would now jump out and go 'Aha, you've been Punk'd, that would never happen.' I waited. But no Ashton. The film went on. And many a reviewer, who probably look like sweet Seth (yes, even the women) gave it a thumbs up."</p><p>Vardalos admits there's a "double standard for women. Whatever, yawn, we all know it, perpetuate it."</p><p>See before and after photos of Us' weight winners.</p><p>"So, it's our fault. Let's accept it and move on. Socially, the issue of men's weight is simply not a big deal. Let's face it: <strong>Russell Crowe</strong> is fat and no one ever talks about it. <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> just orders his suits a size bigger and we continue to swoon."</p><p>Vardalos says "the truth" about her <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> is that she "had a blood sugar problem" and her doctor ordered her to drop weight. "It was really hard, but I did it through exercise, and it took a year," she admits.</p><p>Find out how more stars get fit.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>If not for her health issues, the actress would have kept her curves, she says. "I thought I was attractive when I shot My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Studio executives and movie reviewers let me know I had a confidence in my looks that was not shared by them," she says. "In other words, they labeled me with words like: overweight, unattractive, unappealing."</p><p>"Hey, just say fat. I love the word fat. I used it in the title," she goes on. "It's actually not a naughty word. We give it a power it actually doesn't have. So, you're fat. Big deal."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGanoZFiw6K%2Bw5qjqKtdpL2mutJmrKllkZe8tsCMqameq6Oqv6Z506hkpaejmnp1fIyppq6mlKh6c3yPcmhrbl8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./reebok-club-c-85-vintage-sneaker-has-so-many-celebs-obsessed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Reebok Club C 85 Vintage Sneaker Has So Many Celebs Obsessed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./margot-robbie-uses-lancer-skincare-cleanser.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Margot Robbie Uses Lancer Skincare Cleanser</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
