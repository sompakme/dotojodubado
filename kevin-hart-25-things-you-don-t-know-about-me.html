Read on to find out more facts about the 37-year-old actor in this exclusive list of 25 things you don’t know about him. And catch Hart in his new concert film,&nbsp;<i>Kevin Hart: What Now?</i>, in theaters now!&nbsp;</p><p>1. My favorite childhood memory was when I was tall enough to get on roller coasters.</p><p>2. My dream costar would be <b>Denzel Washington</b>. If I ever do decide to go into a serious role, you need somebody to help bring that strong validation, and who better than him?</p><p>3. I idolize my mother [Nancy Hart], rest in peace. The best advice my mom gave me was that we don’t do things not to finish them.</p><p>4. In my downtime, I’m a hell of a poker player. I have poker night sometimes, but I work too much to stay true to it.</p><span class=caption></span><p>5. My best quality is my personality. I have the ability to make anybody feel comfortable. The energy that I put out, I get back.</p><p>6. I could watch <i>Tropic Thunder</i> over and over. It’s the funniest movie ever.</p><p>7. A guy got a tattoo of my face on his lower back. That was weird. I was like, “I don’t know what you did that for, sir. I don’t know why it’s there. I don’t really know what I’m supposed to do after seeing that. I guess thank you.”&nbsp;</p><p>8. My favorite book is <i>Of Mice and Men,</i> by John Steinbeck. I read it a long time ago. I like that and a book called <i>Monsters,</i> by Walter Dean Myers.</p><p>9. If I could meet anyone, I would choose Robin Williams. I would simply say, “You were loved. Your stamp on comedy is something that definitely wasn’t overlooked.”</p><p>10. When I first started performing in theaters, I was performing in Washington, D.C. I had on some cool nylon <a href=# data-link=1>sweatpants</a>. I was telling a joke, jumped in the air, landed and ripped my pants in the front. But I didn’t know. So the girl in the front row wrote a note and slid it on stage. It said something like, “Kevin, your whole area is out right now.”</p><p>11. My biggest phobia is reptiles. Dogs are fine; reptiles get up under my skin. Snakes, lizards, things of that nature. I can’t do it.</p><p>12. My worst physical qualities are my two big toenails. They look like burned sunflower seeds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kevin-hart-comedy-90c831e2-9d09-41e3-a5a9-be603a53a6ee.jpg><p>13. My kids [Heaven, 11, and Hendrix, 8] definitely think I tell dad jokes. You don’t realize you tell dad jokes until your kids go, “Dad, stop telling dad jokes.”</p><p>14. My favorite thing about being a dad of my kids is doing things that you didn’t do as a kid with your kids. We have Taco Tuesday Night.</p><p>15. In 2015, 53,000 people came to see me perform at a football stadium in Philadelphia. That was one of the most amazing days of my life. I felt like I had to do that day its service, so I turned the stand-up concert into this movie [<i>Kevin Hart: What Now?</i>].</p><p>16. My biggest regret is not giving the full 110 percent that I should have given in school.</p><p>17. I can play the spoons. I just grab spoons and clink them together.</p><p>18. It’s very hard to have a celebrity crush because my wife [model <b>Eniko Parrish</b>, 32] is so amazing.</p><p>19. The best thing about my wife is her ability to make me better.</p><p>20. I always wish that I had starred in <i>Goodfellas</i>. <b>Joe Pesci</b>’s character, Tommy, is a dream role.</p><p>21. If I weren’t an actor, I’d probably be a hand model.</p><p>22. My favorite sport to watch and play is basketball. My favorite team is the Philadelphia 76ers, but don’t tell anybody I said that.</p><p>23. I love black jeans and a nice T-shirt. I have maybe 30 pairs of black jeans.</p><p>24. My go-to joke is, “If I was taller, would I have a chance?” (I’m 5-foot-5.)</p><p>25. I listen to “Sorry,” by <b>Justin Bieber</b>, on repeat. I am 100 percent a Belieber.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKerpmjeqmt0a1ka21dqbWqusasZLKnpWKxsLrTZqKnp6dirqO71K1kpp1drIF1gJNuZ2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./posture-now-shark-tank-founder-net-worth-and-investment.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Posture Now Shark Tank Founder, Net Worth and Investment</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joss-whedon-denies-threatening-gal-gadot-on-justice-league.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joss Whedon Denies Threatening Gal Gadot on 'Justice League'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
