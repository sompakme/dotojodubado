Pop Music and Country Singer. Known for Mixing Folk, Rock, Blues, and Pop into a hugely successful career in Country Music. Juice has sold over 10 million albums. She has managed 19 hit singles across the US country, pop, and adult contemporary charts. She has also won 2 Billboard Awards, 1 Grammy, and the CMA Award for Best New Female Artist. Shortly after high school, Juice and her band Silver Spur were signed to RCA Records. They released three albums and had only one charting single, “Love Is a Word”. Juice signed with Capitol in 1978, dropping the Silver Spur name (though they would remain the backup band).</strong></p><p>That year, she had her first country top-40 single in Let’s Keep It That Way, followed by the single It’s a Heartache, which was quickly overshadowed by Bonnie Tyler’s version. The 1980 album Take Heart featured five more charted singles, including the covers of the ’60s Elvie Sands hit Any Way That You Want Me and the 1972 John Edwards classic Sunshine. The latter became her second top-40 single on the country charts. She was born Judith Kaye Newton on 18 February 1952 in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and grew up in Virginia Beach, Virginia.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=juice-newton-age></span><span>Juice Newton Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Newton is 70 years old as of 2021, she was born on 18 February 1952, in Lakehurst, New Jersey, United States.</strong> She celebrates her <strong>birthday on 18 February </strong>every year and her birth sign is Aquarius.

P. Arnold, Connie Eaton, Mary Mason, Guys ‘n’ Dolls, Melba Montgomery, and Juice Newton. The song was composed in 1967 by Chip Taylor, who said of it: “I wrote Angel of the Morning after hearing The Rolling Stones song Ruby Tuesday on the car radio when I was driving into New York City. I wanted to capture that kind of passion.”</p><p>The highest-charting and best-selling version in the United States were recorded and released in 1981 by country-rock singer Juice Newton for her album&nbsp;<i>Juice.</i>&nbsp;Newton re-interpreted the song at the suggestion of Steve Meyer, who promoted Capitol Records singles and albums to radio stations and felt a version of “Angel of the Morning” by Newton would be a strong candidate for airplay.</p><p>&nbsp;Newton would state that she would never have herself thought of recording “Angel of the Morning,” and even though she immediately recognized the song when Meyer played it for her (quote): “I [hadn’t been] really aware of that song because…when [it] was popular I was listening to folk music and R&B and not pop, and that was a very pop song.”</p><p>The song “Angel”, released by reggae artist&nbsp;Shaggy, heavily samples the melody of “Angel of the Morning”. It reached No. 1 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;Hot 100&nbsp;for the week ending&nbsp;March 31, 2001. Swedish singer&nbsp;Jill Johnson&nbsp;released “Angel of the Morning”, with lyrics in English, in 2007 from her album of&nbsp;cover versions,&nbsp;Music Row. This version peaked at No. 30 on the Swedish singles chart.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=juice-newton-queen-of-hearts></span><span>Juice Newton Queen of Hearts</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Queen of Hearts is a country-pop song written by Hank DeVito, the pedal steel guitarist in Emmylou Harris’s backing group The Hot Band, and was first recorded by Dave Edmunds on his 1979 album Repeat When Necessary. It was released as a single and reached No. 11 in the UK and No. 12 in Ireland that year, but failed to chart substantially elsewhere in the world. The most successful version of the song was recorded by Juice Newton in 1981 – her version reached #2 in the United States, Canada, Australia, Denmark, South Africa, and New Zealand.</p><p>“Queen of Hearts” also gave Newton her second huge international hit, with Top Ten chart positions in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and Switzerland – and more moderate success in Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands.</p><p>Her recording of the song earned Newton a 1982 Grammy nomination for Best Female Vocalist, Country and Western category, “Queen of Hearts” has been a No. 14 countries hit.&nbsp;In June 2014, Newton’s version of the song was ranked No. 92 by&nbsp;Rolling Stone on its list of the 100 greatest country songs of all time.&nbsp;Newton re-recorded “Queen of Hearts” for her 1998 album The Trouble With Angels. In 1997, a live version by Dave Edmunds was released on his compilation album Rockin’.</p><p>Juice Newton’s first version of the song is featured in Oliver Stone’s 1986 film Salvador and the 1997 film Boogie Nights, as well as in the 2004 video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas in which it plays on the fictional radio station K-Rose. It also appears as source music in the first episode of The Americans, a 2013 television series set during the first Reagan administration. The song is also featured in the 1998 King of the Hill episode Hank’s Dirty Laundry and the 2017 South Park episode “Splatty Tomato”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=juice-newton-2020></span><span>Juice Newton 2020</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Juice will not be touring in 2020. The multi-instrumentalist from New Jersey is set to deliver us a collection of her biggest hits. Her Country and Western sound have earned her five Grammy Award nominations in the Pop and Country Best Female Vocalist categories. Not only this, but 6 of her songs have reached number 1 in the charts.</p><p>Newton walks into a very polite amount of applause. It’s not like people are screaming the roof of the place but it’s a generous welcome to this seasoned songstress. She launches into “Angel of the Morning” a beautiful number with her playing her steel-strung acoustic guitar, sporting a clever finger-picking technique which is similar to that of Bluegrass music.</p><p>Newton is very good at engaging the audience to join in and sing with her, she delivers “Tell Her No” and the audience happily obliges in getting involved singing it right back at her. “They Never Made it to Memphis” is that pin drop moment of the set, as she performs a beautifully stripped back version of it on a Rhodes piano, paired with the shimmer of a chorus effect on it. It is no surprise that this venue is sold out.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=juice-newton-the-sweetest-thing-ive-ever-known></span><span>Juice Newton The Sweetest Thing (I’ve Ever Known)</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“The Sweetest Thing (I’ve Ever Known)” is a country-pop song written by Otha Young for Juice Newton in the mid-1970s. Newton was known for charting hits on the Hot 100, AC, and Hot Country charts – and this song has the distinction of being the only single of hers to reach the top 10 on all three of those charts, peaking at #1 on two of them.</p><p>“The Sweetest Thing (I’ve Ever Known)” was originally recorded and released in 1975 on Juice Newton & Silver Spur’s debut album, Juice Newton and Silver Spur (RCA). The 1975 version was not issued as a single, although it was the B-side of two official singles and was issued as a promotional single to U.S. radio stations. In the meantime, Dottsy recorded a version in 1976 and took it to No. 86 on the country music charts, and used it as the title track to her album The Sweetest Thing.</p><p>After becoming a solo artist, Newton re-recorded the song for her 1981 album, the star-making&nbsp;Juice, which was Newton’s third solo album and featured three of her biggest pop hits: “The Sweetest Thing (I’ve Ever Known)”, “Angel of the Morning” and “Queen of Hearts”.</p><p>In early 1982, “The Sweetest Thing (I’ve Ever Known)” reached No. 1 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;adult contemporary chart,&nbsp;No. 1 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;country chart,&nbsp;and No. 7 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;pop chart, where it remained in the&nbsp;Top 40&nbsp;for eighteen weeks.&nbsp;The single is the only of Juice Newton’s to reach the Top 10 on all three charts. On Billboard’s year-end Top 40 chart, the song charted at No. 21 of all the singles of 1982.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=juice-newton-friends></span><span>Juice Newton Friends</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>That recording remained unreleased until the summer of 1986 when it was released shortly after a version by Juice Newton and Eddie Rabbitt hit country radio. The country version featured the altered title of “Both to Each Other (Friends and Lovers)</p><p>In 1986, country-pop singers Juice Newton and Eddie Rabbitt released a version of “Friends and Lovers”, altering the title to emphasize the final line of the chorus. Technically, Newton and Rabbitt’s recording is a&nbsp;pre-release cover version, since it was commercially available before the pop version was released. Therefore, even though Loring and Anderson recorded the song first, Newton and Rabbitt are credited with the original commercial version.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=juice-newton-its-a-heartache></span><span>Juice Newton, It’s a Heartache</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“‘It’s a Heartache’” is a song recorded by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler. Written by Ronnie Scott and Steve Wolfe, and co-produced with David Mackay, the single was released in November 1977 through RCA Records. The song topped the charts in Australia, Canada, and numerous European countries, and reached no. 3 in the USA and no. 4 in the UK. It is listed among the best-selling singles of all time with sales of over six million copies. In the United States, Tyler’s version was released in 1978 around the same time as recordings by Juice Newton and Ronnie Spector.</p><p>“It’s a Heartache” was recorded at The Factory Sound in&nbsp;Surrey,&nbsp;England&nbsp;in 1977. Producer&nbsp;David Mackay&nbsp;finished the construction of his&nbsp;recording studio&nbsp;in the summer of 1977, and “It’s a Heartache” was cut during the very first session.</p><p>“It’s a Heartache” was one of the first recordings Tyler made following a surgical procedure to remove&nbsp;nodules&nbsp;from her&nbsp;vocal folds. The procedure left Tyler with an “unusually husky voice”, which AllMusic journalist Marcy Donelson described as “an effective instrument.</p><p>In 1978, Juice Newton released a cover of the song through Capitol Records, produced by John Palladino. Newton’s version reached no. 86 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and no. 91 on the Canadian RPM 50 Singles Chart. In the same year, Ronnie Spector released the track as a single through Alston Records. Tyler, Newton, and Spector’s versions were all released in the same week in the United States, with Billboard listing each version as “recommended” tracks. Dave & Sugar’s 1981 cover of “It’s a Heartache” reached no. 32 on the Billboard Country Singles Chart. Trick Pony released a cover of the song in 2005, peaking at no. 22 on the same chart.</p><p>In 2004, Tyler released a bilingual version of the song with French singer Kareen Antonn. Renamed “Si tout s’arrête”, the single reached no. 7 on the Belgian Flanders chart, no. 12 in France and no. 25 in Switzerland. In the following year, Tyler released a solo version of the song, sung entirely in English, on her album Wings.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=juice-newton-quiet-lies></span><span>Juice Newton Quiet Lies</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Quiet Lies is a 1982 album by American pop-country star Juice Newton. It reached #20 on the Billboard pop chart and includes three major hits, “Love’s Been a Little Bit Hard on Me”, “Break It to Me Gently” and “Heart of the Night”. Quiet Lies sold more than 900,000 copies in the United States in 1982 (earning Newton her fourth RIAA Gold certification) and was re-issued on CD in 1990 and 2006.</p><p>“Love’s Been a Little Bit Hard on Me” was the first single released from the 1982 album, for which Newton received a “Best Female Vocalist – Pop” nomination. The video for this song received the “Video of the Year” award from the American Video Association. The song reached the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts. It peaked at #30 on the Country chart.</p><p>The album’s second single — “Break It to Me Gently” (originally a 1962 hit for Brenda Lee) — won Juice Newton her first Grammy in 1983, in the category of “Best Female Vocalist – Country.” The song hit number one on the adult contemporary chart, number two on the country chart, and number 11 on the Hot 100. “Heart of the Night”, written by John Bettis and Michael Clark, was the opening track for the album. It was released as the third and final single, reaching number four on the adult contemporary chart and 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1983.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=juice-newton-today></span><span>Juice Newton Today</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Newton had always been moderately popular in country music; she responded to her waning popularity in the pop market by targeting her next album, 1985’s Old Flame, solely to country audiences. The strategic move was a success; the album revitalized her career, reached No. 12 on the Billboard album chart, and featured six Top-10 country hits, including the No. 1s “You Make Me Want to Make You Mine”, “Hurt,” and “Both to Each Other (Friends and Lovers)” (with Eddie Rabbitt), none of which (unlike her previous efforts) appeared at all on the pop charts.</p><p>The duet was released to the public before the pop version “Friends and Lovers” by Gloria Loring and Carl Anderson; the pop version was released to radio and stores two weeks after Newton and Rabbitt’s version first appeared, even though it was recorded first. Newton’s version was originally available only on a special edition of the Old Flame album and on the Eddie Rabbitt album Rabbitt Traxx. The “Old Flame” album produced hit singles for more than sixteen months, with the final release being “What Can I Do with My Heart” (written by Otha Young), which reached the Top 10 in early 1987.</p><p>After being dropped by RCA Records in 1989 (along with several other country artists, including&nbsp;Dolly Parton&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kenny Rogers, as country music as a whole was about to undergo momentous change), Newton took time to focus on her family life. Newton took a hiatus from recording albums, touring sporadically until returning to the music scene in the late 1990s when she released the albums “The Trouble with Angels” (1998) and “American Girl” (1999)</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=juice-newton-rca></span><span>Juice Newton RCA</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Juice left Capitol to return to RCA in 1984. Her first album Can’t-Wait All Night continued with a more rock sound. The first single “A Little Love” and the title track became her final Top 40 pop singles reaching #42 and #66 respectively while “Restless Heart” made it to 57 on the country chart. The following year, Juice had her most successful country album yet in Old Flame, featuring five top-10 country hits (including the #1s “You Make Me Want to Make You Mine” and “Hurt”).</p><p>In 1986, she dueted on “Both to Each Other (Friends and Lovers)” with Eddie Rabbit, giving her another country #1. She continued her top-10 streak the next year with “Tell Me True” from Emotion while another single “First Time Caller” peaked at 24. However, her final album of the decade “Ain’t Gonna Cry”, released in 1989, didn’t chart but did spawn her final Top-40 country hit, “When Love Comes around the Bend”.</p><p>Juice recorded a duet album in the early 90s but it was met with legal issues, resulting in a very low-impact release of the Platinum & Gold Series of duets. Juice spent the next 9 years touring, horseback riding, and focusing on family life.</p><p>She returned in 1998 with “the Trouble with Angels,” a collection of re-recorded favorites and several new tracks.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=juice-newton-top-10-greatest-hits></span><span>Juice Newton Top 10 Greatest Hits</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Angel of the Morning</li><li>Heart of the Night</li><li>Love’s Been a Little Bit Hard On Me</li><li>Break It to Me Gently</li><li>So many Ways</li><li>Lay Back in the Arms of Someone</li><li>Hey Baby</li><li>Shot Full of Love</li><li>Dirty Looks</li><li>Tell her No</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=juice-newton-albums></span><span>Juice Newton Albums</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The album features two #1 hits “Angel of the Morning” and “The Sweetest Thing (I’ve Ever Known)”. It also contains “Queen of Hearts,” the biggest-selling single of Juice Newton’s career, which peaked at #2 on both Billboard’s Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts&nbsp;(“Endless Love” by Diana Ross and Lionel Richie prevented the song from reaching #1). “Queen of Hearts” was a popular music video during the summer of&nbsp;MTV’s debut. Newton would go on to have more hit songs and albums, but this remains the album for which she is best known.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=juice-newton-awards></span><span>Juice Newton Awards</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Juice&nbsp;garnered Juice Newton two “Best Female Vocalist”&nbsp;Grammy Award&nbsp;nominations (in the Pop and Country categories, respectively) neither of which she won.
