While Hardy struggled during his school years, he found his calling in the world of drama by playing minor television roles and performing in plays. During the early 2000s, his career slowly gained momentum as he starred in independent movies. As his name became popular amongst the critics’ circle, Hardy began working with major production houses, starring in mainstream movies that took his career to new heights. His rugged good looks and cerebral performances have <a href=#>made him one of the most talented and celebrated artists of his generation</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From struggling with addictions during the early years of his career to getting back on his feet and working his way to the top, Tom Hardy has climbed a long ladder of success to reach the spot.

As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Esquire</a>, Hardy used to get into trouble during his school years, using alcohol and drugs as an escape. He was arrested for joyriding while possessing a gun. The actor was addicted to drugs and alcohol during his active teenage years. He first contacted the Entertainment Industry while participating in a television modeling competition in 1998. This competition earned him an industry contract.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While studying at Drama Center London, Hardy was expelled due to his absence and drug habits.
