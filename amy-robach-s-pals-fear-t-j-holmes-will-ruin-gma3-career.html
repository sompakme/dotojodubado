GMA3’s <a href=#><strong>Amy Robach</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>T.J. Holmes</strong></a>’ relationship scandal has her close pals worried about her future, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly.</p><p>“Amy’s friends fear he’s not only going to break her heart but also ruin her career,” the insider says.</p><p>The <a href=#>GMA3: What You Need to Know</a> cohosts <a href=#>turned heads last month</a> when photos surfaced on Wednesday, November 30, that showed them getting cozy on multiple occasions.</p><p>During one outing, the coworkers — who are both married to other people and have yet to announce any official updates on those relationships — were seen laughing at a bar together. In another snap, <a href=#>Holmes</a>, 45, was spotted playfully touching Robach’s backside while she was loading a car.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Amy-and-TJ.jpg><p>Holmes and Robach’s relationship “<a href=#>blossomed from a close friendship</a>,” a source exclusively told Us at the time, noting, “They always had a spark and their work trips away together brought them even closer.”</p><p>The journalists<a href=#> returned to GMA3 on Thursday, December 1</a>, but didn’t directly comment on their relationship status. Instead, the twosome hinted at the <a href=#>awkward rumors about their dynamic swirling</a>.</p><p>“It’s Friday eve,” Robach, 49, said during the broadcast. Holmes then asked, “Who’s looking forward to the weekend?” before the University of Georgia alum raised her hand. “Of course we are. Welcome, everybody, to GMA3: What You Need to Know. Always good to see you.” One day later, the pair joked about <a href=#>having a “great week”</a> during their Friday, December 2, segment.</p><p>Us confirmed on Monday, December 5, that Robach and Holmes <a href=#>would not be featured</a> on Good Morning America’s third hour <a href=#>for the foreseeable future</a> amid their relationship scandal. They will be temporarily replaced by fellow ABC News anchors <a href=#><strong>Stephanie Ramos</strong> and <strong>Gio Benitez</strong></a>.</p><p>“Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes have the day off,” Ramos, 40, explained during Monday’s broadcast.</p><p>Earlier this month, however, a source exclusively told Us that <a href=#>the GMA team was aware of the Michigan native and the former CNN reporter’s flirtation</a> for “many months” before news broke of the romance.</p><p>“Amy and T.J. have been arriving to work pretending like everything is normal, they have been carrying on like they would any other day,” the insider explained. “The GMA staff for the most part all knew that something was happening between Amy and T.J., they were always playful with each other, like two people who were dating.”</p><p>The <a href=#>longtime ABC anchors</a> “didn’t seem like they were trying to keep their relationship secret anymore, everyone around the office could tell there was a spark between them for many months,” the insider added.</p><p>Robach and Holmes’ spouses have also stayed mum on the scandal. The <a href=#>Better Together! author</a> married actor <strong>Andrew Shue</strong> in February 2010. The twosome have been <a href=#>vocal over the years about their blended family</a>, which includes Robach’s two daughters, Ava, 20, and Analise, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband <strong>Tim McIntosh</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The reporter is also the stepmother to <a href=#>the Melrose Place alum’s three children</a> — Nate, 26, Aidan, 23, and Wyatt, 18 — from Shue’s previous marriage to <strong>Jennifer Hageney</strong>. Shue, 55, <a href=#>has since wiped Robach from his social media accounts</a>.</p><p>Holmes, <a href=#>for his part</a>, welcomed daughter Brianna and son Jaiden with first wife <strong>Amy Ferson</strong> before they called it quits in 2007. He married <a href=#><strong>Marilee Fiebig</strong></a> in March 2010. The duo <a href=#>share 9-year-old daughter</a> Sadine. Fiebig, 44, has a private Instagram profile.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapaliv7CuwJyfrGWglrm0ecWemKtlpGK3brTOpaSeq12stq24jKusoqZdnLqif4ycmKudlad8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adriano-leite-ribeiro-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Adriano Leite Ribeiro Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
