That singular decision has not only made her one of the most outstanding actresses in recent times but also turned her into a star to look out for in most television projects.</p><p>From sitcoms like <i>Whitney </i>to dramas like <i>Better Call Saul</i>, Rhea Seehorn’s stock as an actress has been rising in recent years. Also, growing along with her filmography is her bank account, enough for her to look back at her beginnings and smile.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rhea-seehorn-survived-on-odd-jobs-before-her-career-took-off></span><strong>Rhea Seehorn Survived On Odd Jobs Before Her Career Took Off</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She was born on May 12, 1972,&nbsp;in Norfolk, Virginia. Rhea’s mother was an executive assistant, and her father worked in the Naval Investigative Service as an agent. Her father’s profession meant the family relocated a lot and she lived in places like Arizona, Washington, D.C and Japan.</p><p>Growing up under her parents, Rhea Seehorn developed an interest in the arts, specifically visual arts. She studied painting, drawing and architecture from her father and grandmother. Her interest in visual arts went with her to college, at George Mason University, where she studied Studio Art.</p><p>During her education, Rhea remained on the path to becoming an artist until a decision to explore acting as an elective course derailed her childhood plans. She fell in love with acting and found a new dream.</p><p>The pursuit of her dream led her to local theatres, where she worked as an auxiliary staff. She worked as a stage-running crew, at the box office and in other roles, all in a bid to find a path into professional work. Soon, her hard work and tenacity paid off and she secured parts in local productions but while they gave Rhea Seehorn the chance to nurture her skills, they did not pay well.</p><p>Thus, to pay her bills and keep a roof over her head, the actress worked odd jobs, such as re-caulking bathtubs and clerking at a record store. Although she did not have any experience, she also did home repairs. It took a while, as character acting tendencies kept her from securing the eye-candy roles she auditioned for.</p><p>Eventually, Rhea began securing onscreen roles, which paid significantly better, starting with a guest episode appearance in Homicide: Life on the Street.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=she-has-appeared-in-over-42-film-and-tv-shows></span><strong>She Has Appeared In Over 42 Film And TV Shows</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the early days of her onscreen career, Rhea Seehorn worked on brief and one-off appearances in long-running shows as well as minor film roles. Some of her early credits include A Case Against Karen, Riders, Eat Me!, The Gentleman and The Pitch.</p><p>Her first notable part came in 2003 when she played Cheri Baldzikowski in the short-lived comedy, I’m with Her. She appeared in 22 episodes of the show’s single season. While it did not raise her stock as an actress, it improved her earnings and allowed her to pursue other roles.</p><p>Other roles did come along, like Nicole Walker in Head Cases, Ashley Schwartz in Romy and Michele: In the Beginning. She also starred in multiple episodes of The Singles Table and The Starter Wife. In 2011, she found another long-running role in Whitney, as Roxanne. She appeared in 38 episodes of the sitcom, but like I’m with Her, it did not last on air.</p><p>Still, while stability and critical success eluded Rhea Seehorn, she continued to rake in cash with appearances in minor or semi-major roles. Before she began her breakout role as Kim Wexler in Better Call Saul, Rhea appeared in a total of 42 films and TV shows.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rhea-seehorns-acting-career-has-made-her-rich></span><strong>Rhea Seehorn’s Acting Career Has Made Her Rich</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When Rhea Seehorn moved to Los Angeles, she was doing odd jobs and struggled to pay her bills. Today, based on figures calculated by reliable sources, Rhea has an estimated net worth of $3 million. Unlike sports where contract details are public knowledge, the exact income from each of her 42 credits remains undisclosed.</p><p>However, common knowledge suggests projects where she starred in prominent roles, are the most significant sources of her growing wealth. Those include her breakout show, Better Call Saul, where she played the lead and has starred in more than 60 episodes across the main show and its miniseries, Better Call Saul: Ethics Training with Kim Wexler. Others include Veep, Whitney, Franklin & Bash, The Singles Table and I’m with Her.</p><p>Offscreen, Rhea has made money appearing in Broadway plays like 45 Seconds from Broadway, All My Sons, How I Learned to Drive, Freedomland, Marat/Sad, and Stop Kiss. With her career well on the rise, there is no doubt that Rhea’s wealth can only continue to grow.</p><p>It is not just her bank account that has grown in recent years either. Rhea’s award cabinet has also seen an increase with four wins from five nominations so far. Her victories include OFTA Television Award, Satellite Awards, and the Saturn Award. She has received nominations from the Critics Choice Award, Gold Derby TV Award and IGN Award.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rhea-has-been-married-to-graham-larson-since-2018></span><strong>Rhea Has Been Married To Graham Larson Since 2018</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rhea Seehorn joins a plethora of actors and actresses in the entertainment industry who prefer to keep all the details about their love life under the radar. However, we have learned that she is a married woman, hitched to a Hollywood outsider – a real estate agent named Graham Larson.</p><p>The two met in 2013 before Rhea became a recognizable face in the industry. Even more interesting is how she met her husband. Rhea and Graham met after an introduction by Mary Alice Haney, a fashion designer and Larson’s ex-wife.</p><p>Rhea, who is Mary’s friend, met him after what the fashion designer described as ‘the most amazing divorce but a really terrible marriage’. In typical fashion, the couple had a quiet wedding in 2018, and since then, Rhea has been a stepmother to Graham’s two children from his previous marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCfrHquwcKhZKannprGbrTArGSroJWWerSxxKGmq6Zdoq6lsYyfqailXZawtbXNoGSappRixKm7jKKqZquYmnqlrdOipaBn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./janelle-mon%C3%A1e-exposes-breast-during-essence-festival-performance.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Janelle Mone Exposes Breast During Essence Festival Performance</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./elle-macpherson-looks-powerful-in-a-cape-on-the-red-carpet.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Elle Macpherson Looks Powerful in a Cape on the Red Carpet</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
