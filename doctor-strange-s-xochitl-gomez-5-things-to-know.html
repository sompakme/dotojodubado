The character was originally written for someone in their late teens, but a then 14-year-old Gomez decided to take a chance and send in an audition tape anyway. By her second reading, they had tweaked the role to open it up to a larger range of actresses.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I might have a shot at this!'” she recalled. “So I did some stunt training for a full month, every other day for a couple hours, and then I did the test. And two days later, I found out I was cast. It all went pretty quick!”</p><p>Though she has been acting since the age of 5, <a href=#>Doctor Strange was the biggest project</a> that Gomez has been a part of, and it took some time for her to process that she was playing a superhero. “My reaction was basically, ‘Oh, great, wow.’ Then of course, as I get off the call, I’m like, ‘Did that really just happen?'” she told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in June 2021. “Of course, it took me probably two or three days until it actually hit.”</p><p>The You’re the Worst actress continued: “That’s when I actually, I cried. I mean, my mom didn’t know. I don’t want her to know, but I definitely, at night I cried. It’s just crazy that I get to be a part of this crazy, huge thing. It’s so just insane.”</p><p>Introduced in September 2011 before joining the Young Avengers in January 2013, <a href=#>America Chavez is a tough, wise-cracking teenager</a> with the ability to travel through multiple dimensions and powers that include superhuman strength, invulnerability, and the ability to explode her enemies into star fragments with a single punch. However, <a href=#>when fans meet her in Doctor Strange</a>, she’s just discovering her powers and learning about the multiverse. “It was very important for me to keep that youthful, fake-it-till-you-make-it kind of vibe,” Gomez told Entertainment Weekly in May 2022 about her approach to playing a 14-year-old America.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“In this movie, there’s a lot of heavy stuff going on. It’s not easy when you’re a teenager and you have all this pressure and crazy stuff going on around you,” she continued. “You have to remember that you are a kid. You’re allowed to make mistakes, and we’re all learning. … It was kind of fun <a href=#>taking the version from the comics</a> and making her younger and less experienced.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about Gomez:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BZvKTAzqtkrKyilruosdJmr6ibmJ7BrXnGqKSesl1qerW0yKeerGWkpHqsus6wZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./here-s-how-idina-menzel-manages-to-look-the-same-as-she-did-15-years-ago.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Here's How Idina Menzel Manages to Look the Same As She Did 15 Years Ago</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./billboard-music-awards-2023-red-carpet-see-the-stars-at-the-bbmas.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Billboard Music Awards 2023 Red Carpet: See the Stars at the BBMAs</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
