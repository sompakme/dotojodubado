I learned the reasoning behind those behaviors was because of my dad," she shared.</p><p>In the premiere of her 2021 documentary, Dancing With the Devil, Lovato bravely opened up about how her strained connection with her father influenced her upbringing. "... I longed for that relationship with him. Then I resented him because he was an addict and an alcoholic, and he was abusive to my mom.
