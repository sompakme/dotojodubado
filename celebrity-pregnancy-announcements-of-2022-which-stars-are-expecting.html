Aimee and I have wanted to start a family since the day we were married,” the dad-to-be captioned their maternity shoot photos at the time. “Things don’t always go as we plan. What followed for us was multiple fertility doctors, multiple fertility clinics, an IUI attempt, two rounds of IVF — one a complete failure, and a miscarriage this summer after finally getting pregnant for the very first time. I watched my wife take hundreds of shots and injections, go through procedures and tests and walk through the physical and emotional roller coaster of the infertility process.”</p><p>Luke called their upcoming arrival a “miracle” in the caption, concluding, “God is so good and so faithful. So — today we are beyond thrilled to share that we are pregnant with a baby boy. My wife is the strongest person I know. This has been the most humbling and exhausting season and yet God has answered our prayers. I can’t wait to see Aimee as a mother. And also can’t wait to give this little guy a sweet mullet for his first haircut. Thank you to those that walked with us through this. Thank for your prayers and encouragement. Baby Boy Rodgers we can’t wait to meet you in July.”</p><p>Aimee shared the news with a post of her own, writing that she was “so thankful” to have conceived.</p><p>“My relationship with God has deepened,” the expectant star captioned her reveal. “My marriage is stronger than ever.
