The vaccine is given in two doses, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins after the first dose but reaches full effect seven days after the second dose.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Matthew Perry Debuts 'Friends' Clothing Line To Aid COVID 19 Relief Efforts" href=#>Matthew Perry Debuts 'Friends' Clothing Line To Aid COVID 19 Relief Efforts</a></span></p><p>The UK is currently undertaking the largest vaccination campaign in its history. After Shakespeare received his shot, he began trending on Twitter with many adding to the list of the puns based on the author’s works, including, “The Taming of the Flu” and “The Gentlemen of Corona.” Another Twitter user asked if the first person to get the shot was Patient 1A, “would William Shakespeare be 2B, or not 2B?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shakespeare has been hospitalized for several weeks after suffering a stroke. On Tuesday, after receiving his shot, he felt fatigued and took a nap, according to his niece, Emily Shakespeare. “He’s delighted with it,” she said. “He’s dying to come home. He is fed up being in the hospital, but today, I just want to say that I’m proud that he’s leading the way.”</p><p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 60,000 people have died in the UK and more than 1.5 million people worldwide as a result of <a href=#>COVID-19 complications</a>. The UK hopes to continue vaccinating 11,000 people per day. Hospitals have been given trays of 975 doses each, which must be stored in deep freezers, defrosted and immediately administered. Defrosted doses not given by Friday would be unusable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the US, the FDA said on Tuesday that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine being given in the UK, provided strong <a href=#>protection against Covid-19</a> within about 10 days after the first dose, sooner than had been believed.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>BBC</a></p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title='LA Mayor Says "It&#39;s Time to Cancel Everything" Amid COVID-19 Spike' href=#>LA Mayor Says "It's Time to Cancel Everything" Amid COVID-19 Spike</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmivmaG5qq3MZqqhmZuawLGxwKucZqGjYsCmr86nm2aolafAsLqMraZmn5WpeqS71aKbZmlpYsOir8KipZ5lmaN6treO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./it-takes-two-cast-where-are-they-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'It Takes Two' Cast: Where Are They Now?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sinbad-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sinbad Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
