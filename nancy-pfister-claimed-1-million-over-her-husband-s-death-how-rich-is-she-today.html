People are still seeking answers in this case.</strong></p><p>Let’s find out more about Nancy and what she is doing.</p><p>One of the notorious murder cases in Aspen is of Nancy Pfister and the buzz around it has not still reduced because people believe there was more to the case than what was presented in the court.</p><p>It was reported that Pfister was murdered by a man named Trey Styler, who used to live with his wife in rent in Pfister’s house. As per the reports written about the case, the murder was done because of a conflict that was instigated about rent.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-nancy-pfisters-net-worth-in-2022></span>What Is Nancy Pfister’s Net Worth In 2022?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nancy Pfister probably had a net worth of more than $500,000 before her death. She was the woman who was considered to be a small-town socialite and had properties secluded from the city noise.</p><p>Nancy Styler is the woman who was given freedom or exoneration after her husband confessed to the murder. There have been always doubts about her from the people, but she has been freed from the charges by the court.</p><p>It was reported that after her husband’s suicide, she received a massive amount of $1 million from insurance. This news mad</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=trey-styler-death-claim></span>Trey Styler Death Claim<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Trey was the man who was convicted for the death of Pfister after he confessed the crime. As per his confession, his wife was not involved in the crime, so she was set free to go.</p><p>After he was sentenced to 20 years in prison, he committed suicide in his jail cell. This made news across the media. People believe that he lied about the murder and that his wife was also an accomplice.</p><p>However, these are mere speculations, that people make about every mysterious thing, so there is no certain answer. However, Mrs. Styler is the woman who was set free by the court.</p><p>IMAGES FOR EPISODE 89 – 1. Nancy Pfister 2. Trey & Nancy Styler 3. Nancy’s home 4.
