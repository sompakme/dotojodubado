The 57-year-old <a href=#>DJ </a>went on his own <a href=#>rant</a> and drew the ire of social media users.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Real sh*t, I’m tired of seeing narcissistic chicks in their camera all day,” he wrote in an Instagram post, which was a screenshot of his comment on one of Gillie’s posts. “Show me you know how to take care of a business, take care of a child, a home or how smart you are, show me a talent!!” He questioned the hygiene of these women, seemingly targeting content creators who post photos at all hours of the day.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Some chicks wake up at 7 in the morning and the first thing they do before washing their a** or brush teeth, or even get breakfast, they post a picture with their fat a** bent over at 7 in the m0rning!” he wrote. “Fact is, there are plenty of bad chicks all over the world, ok, what’s next? When’s the last time you seen a young woman dance regular without twerking?” Watch Gillie’s rant and read Capri’s lengthy comment below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">That wasn’t all either, as Kid Capri had more thoughts to share in his caption. “Being sexy is one thing, over doing it is another,” he wrote. “No hate at all, and I really don’t care if you don’t agree, but @gilliedaking said he’s tired of woman calling themselves bad b**ches, and I agree,,, Sh*ts corny!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">One fan had no issue going paragraph for paragraph with the <a href=#>Brooklyn rapper</a>. “Policing women is at an all time high,” they wrote. “If it’s not someone you are in a healthy relationship with, why speak on it? How is it effecting you? Why so much focus on controlling what some women do or don’t do based on your own moral standard? If it’s not for you, then it’s not for you. Posting these ‘hot takes’ just opens the door for women bashing.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Another man called him out for not minding his business. “Why is it anyone’s business what they post on their page?” they asked. “People, especially us men need to mind our business about how women conduct theirs.” Another user believed that he ought to just pay attention to the women in his generation who aren’t so obsessed with their cameras. “Get a woman your age!” they wrote with a laughing emoji.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1508425884.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Outside of his rants targeted at women, Kid Capri is enjoying a cancer-free life. In December 2023, he announced that he beat the disease. “God is great! 3 days ago, I found out that I’m cancer free!” he wrote on Instagram. “Been dealing with it all year while I was doing everything I was doing for hip hop 50. I had 2 surgeries and never said anything publicly about what I was going through, I’m not an attention whore, so I didn’t want to say anything, so that it didn’t look like i wanted [pity.]”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6C2pXnCmqeroV2Yrq240mamrqxdo66zr8isqqKrpJ6wbq%2FHopqkq12lwrS0wZqapGWWlru0eZBram1waWWEdIKO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mom-details-every-parents-nightmare-with-stepmom-who-has-no-boundaries.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mom Details Every Parents Nightmare With Stepmom Who Has No Boundaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kevin-hart-wants-you-to-vote-on-which-of-his-friends-is-the-dumbest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kevin Hart Wants You To Vote On Which Of His Friends Is 'The Dumbest'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
