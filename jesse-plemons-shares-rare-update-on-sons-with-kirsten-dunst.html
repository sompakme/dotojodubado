This was, I think, before our oldest child was born and you sent a few books,” Plemons recalled during his appearance on the late-night show. “They provided some great times for us. We really enjoyed them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jesse-Plemons-Gives-Rare-Update-on-His-and-Kirsten-Dunsts-2-Sons-Reveals-Why-His-5-Year-Old-Has-Him-Worried-071.jpg><p>The Oscar nominee, who shares Ennis, 4, and <a href=#>James, 2</a>, with his wife, 40, noted that Fallon’s books — which include <a href=#>Everything Is Mama, You Baby’s First Word Will Be Dada and This Is Baby</a> — are “for young kids, wouldn’t you say?”</p><p>Plemons then joked that the material’s ideal reading age has become problematic in his house.</p><p>“Our kid is [almost] 5 now, and all he wants to read is Mama and Dada book[s] … I’m worried about his progress,” the Love & Death star confessed, clarifying that Ennis will turn 5 in May.</p><p>The Texas native, <a href=#>who met the Bring It On actress while filming FX’s Fargo in 2015</a>, revealed that he’s read Fallon’s material “thousands of times,” playfully adding, “I’m tired of the book!”</p><p>The <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> alum, 48, insisted that it’s “fantastic” that Ennis likes the Mama and Dada stories.</p><p>Plemons, however, wasn’t buying it. “It’s the equivalent of Baby Shark, this book,” he said, noting that it’s not all bad because Fallon somehow “cracked some child’s mind code.”</p><p>All jokes aside, the Jungle Cruise actor confessed he wanted the Fever Pitch star to write another book. Fallon was one step ahead and pulled out a copy of his 2022 release, Nana Loves You More, which he gifted to Plemons’ family.</p><p>“I’m excited and I’m a little scared,” the Irishman star said of the new story.</p><p>Plemons’ <a href=#>candid quotes about his home life were rare</a>, as the Breaking Bad alum has kept much of his relationship with Dunst under wraps. The <a href=#>twosome began dating in 2016</a>, and Us Weekly confirmed one year later that they were engaged.</p><p>The Beguiled actress <a href=#>gave birth to the couple’s first child</a>, Ennis, in May 2018. The pair <a href=#>welcomed son James</a> in April 2021. As the couple expanded their family, they also reunited on screen, starring in 2021’s The Power of the Dog.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“They’ve started working together on projects and it’s made their relationship even stronger,” an insider <a href=#>exclusively told Us in December 2021</a>. “They love to spend as much time together as possible.”</p><p>The film’s success led to Oscar nominations for both Plemons and Dunst. The movie earned a total of 12 nods at the February 2022 awards show.</p><p>While the twosome didn’t win their respective categories, they did have something to celebrate. Us confirmed in July 2022 that <a href=#>the longtime couple tied the knot</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajnaOosm68y56kqKajYsCprdGeqmaqkaeybsHPnZitnV2ku26%2FzqeqZq%2BZqbVut8irqq2dnmKxtrrSrWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kevin-kisner-net-worth-how-much-is-kevin-kisner-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kevin Kisner Net Worth How Much is Kevin Kisner Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-david-tafuri-gay-wife-wikipedia-age-bio-facts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is David Tafuri Gay?
