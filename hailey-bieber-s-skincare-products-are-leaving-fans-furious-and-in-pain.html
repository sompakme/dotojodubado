In October 2014, she made her first runway debut for Topshop and French fashion designer Sonia Rykiel. After making a breakthrough in her modeling career, Hailey went on to land appearances in several high-profile publications, including Vogue (2015) and Teen Vogue, as well as shooting for fashion brands such as Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Jimmy Choo, and Tiffany. She has also appeared in a handful of other popular publications. However, the young American-born model has since made an even bigger name for herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After getting married to Justin Bieber, Hailey Bieber has been plunged into the spotlight in a way that she has never experienced before. Marrying such a high-profile celebrity has landed the young American model in front of millions of fresh, young, and impressionable eyes, and in turn, massively increasing her influence. Now, her latest venture, RHODE skin has launched. Has it been a success or failure for the Hollywood fashion mogul?</p><h2 id=hailey-launched-rhode-skincare-to-create-39-accessible-products-that-work-39>Hailey Launched RHODE Skincare To Create 'Accessible Products That Work'</h2><p>While Hailey has been best known for being a model for quite some time, the young socialite is now branching out into new territories. The beauty and fashion mogul launched a new skincare brand 'RHODE Skin' in June 2022.</p><p>On her website, it details that her reasoning for starting the brand was that she wanted to create 'products that really work' in a way that is 'accessible to everyone.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with Allure magazine</a>, her passion for her products was reflected in the research she did individually while developing her line of skincare products.</p><p>She explained, "I was ordering crazy amounts of skin care, trying everything that was expensive to inexpensive to mid-range. I found that the most tried-and-true stuff were the solidly formulated products that were affordable, where I could tell people kept on going back to, and that's what I kept going back to as well."</p><p>During the same interview, she went on to additionally explain that 'no decision was made without her,' that she was 'extremely picky,' and that she wants to give people the best amazing products. These sentiments are certainly reflective of her reasoning behind the brand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While developing the new products, Hailey also managed to stir up a substantial amount of interest in her brand via the social media platform Instagram. It is thanks to this 'hype' that the brand had a successful launch, at least for most fans.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Why Did Justin Bieber And Hailey Baldwin Break Up In 2016?">Why Did Justin Bieber And Hailey Baldwin Break Up In 2016?</a></span></p><p>However, other celebrity skincare brands have come under the firing line in recent months, with many being labeled as a 'cash-grab' by an audience seemingly growing tired of celebrity skincare and beauty lines.</p><p>This is reflected in the recent rise in celebrity beauty brands over the last several years.

In particular, for its watermelon flavor peptide lip treatment, which some disappointed purchasers accused of 'burning' their lips and causing 'severe blistering' after usage.</p><p>Other <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">users with similar experiences took to TikTok to share similar experiences</a>, with other buyers experiencing the same effects on their lips. Some users even explained that many of the issues stopped once they stopped using the product, suggesting that the watermelon lip treatment was the root of their skin irritation issues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Users took to the comments, with one buyer stating "THIS HAPPENED TO ME", with another commenting, "wait this happened to me. Not immediately though. I was using it for a bit and now my lips are inflamed, chapped, and my corners are cracked."</p><p>However, other users defended the products, suggesting that maybe the user had an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients, while others praised the product.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Celebrities Who Tried To Find Success With Skincare Lines">Celebrities Who Tried To Find Success With Skincare Lines</a></span></p><p>RHODE Skincare has also recently found itself in hot water within the legal world, with the <a href=#>brand being sued for copyright infringement</a> over their company name by two owners of a New York-based fashion line.</p><p>The two fashion-brand owners from New York have argued that their brand reputation has suffered since the launch of Hailey's line, with buyers getting confused with the two brands on social media platforms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=other-fans-praised-the-skincare-line>Other Fans Praised The Skincare Line</h2><p>Despite facing some setbacks, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it seems a lot of fans are still enjoying Hailey's new skincare line</a>.
