During the show's preparation, Swift was also asked to appear in a Please Don't Destroy digital short titled "Three Sad Virgins." Swift not only agreed to appear in the short, but she even pitched some of her own jokes.</p><p>Such a move would be expected of a pop star at Swift's level. However, this wouldn't be the first time Swift pitched her own ideas to the SNL team. In fact, Swift first pitched an idea to SNL as her star was rising.</p><p>In 2009, Swift hosted SNL at just 19 years old. SNL alum Seth Meyers would later reveal to Howard Stern how Swift wrote her own song for the opening monologue and pitched it to creator Lorne Michaels.</p><p>Needless to say, the move impressed Meyers and the song was featured in the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-got-huge-praise-after-she-presented-her-opening-monologue-song-on-snl>Taylor Swift Got Huge Praise After She Presented Her Opening Monologue Song On SNL</h2><p>In January 2009, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift appeared on Saturday Night Live for the first time</a>. Although the singer was on the verge of becoming a huge star, she only appeared in one skit. Her main role that night was that of musical guest.</p><p>In November of that year, Swift appeared on the show again, this time as the host. Her hosting duties are even more impressive when you consider that Swift herself was only 19 at the time. During her opening monologue, Swift sang a song referencing many of the things people have said about her.</p><p>In the song, Swift mentioned writing songs about those who have wronged her, breaking up with Joe Jonas, rumors of her dating Taylor Lautner, and her infamous run-in with Kanye West at the MTV Video Music Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift wrote the song herself and when Seth Meyers appeared on The Howard Stern Show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he reflected on the moment the singer presented the song behind-the-scenes</a>.</p><p>"It really speaks to what a force of nature she is and the depths of her talent," Meyers said. "Here's a 19-year-old who nobody is really helping out; nobody gave her a manual of how to do that show. And yet, she came to us and said, 'I wrote a song for the opening monologue.' So we brought Taylor into Lorne [Michaels, SNL creator]'s office, and she sings this song which is not only a beautiful song by a beautiful singer, it's a perfect SNL monologue.

"When she finished I should've said, 'Now Taylor, just for you, I want to look at you and read what we had written for you just so you know how much f****** worse it was.

According to Variety, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this was a surprise to not just the audience, but even to the SNL crew themselves</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An article published in the outlet claims that the production crew at SNL received word Swift and Kelce wanted to stop by the show minutes before it was set to begin.</p><p>Kelce was brought on to appear in the night's cold open, which was a parody of Fox NFL Sunday. The skit poked fun at the NFL's current fascination with Swift and her relationship to Kelce. Anchor Curt Menefee was played by Kenan Thompson. In the skit, Curt became increasingly frustrated with co-anchors Terry Bradshaw (Molly Kearney), Howie Long (Mikey Day), Michael Strahan (Devon Walker) and Jimmy Johnson (James Austin Johnson) as they rave about Swift.</p><p>When Curt refers to "Bad Blood," the co-anchors begin singing the song by Swift. This is when he has had enough.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/your-paragraph-text-2023-11-10t173733-797.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift And Her Team Banned A Major TV Network's Request To Play Her Music, And It Was All Because Of Travis Kelce</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's team was quick to deny FOX access for her music given the reasoning for its usage.</span><p>"You know what, I’m done.

She once again offered her input in 2021 when she appeared on the show as the night's musical guest.</p><p>Swift appeared in an SNL digital short titled "Three Sad Virgins." The short was the brainchild of John Higgins, Martin Herlihy and Ben Marshall of Please Don't Destroy. The men had picked up where The Lonely Island left off and this was one of many shorts they created for the series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar52416124.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">While appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>, the Please Don't Destroy members reflected on getting Swift's approval to appear in the skit.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-s-private-jet-usage-has-been-the-source-of-intense-backlash-and-a-bizarre-conspiracy-theory.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's Private Jet Usage Has Been The Source Of Backlash And Conspiracy Theories</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has gotten a lot of negative attention for flying via private jet and there's even a conspiracy theory about the topic...</span><p>"We didn’t think that she would do it," Higgins said. "[SNL writer] Dan Bulla, who wrote it with us, said, ‘We should have Taylor Swift do it’… and we were like, ‘yeah, obviously!'” So, they pitched it to her — including mentioning the name of the bit and how it would consist of her and Davidson roasting them — and she was immediately like, “‘Yes!’ and was like, ‘I get that about you guys.'"</p><p>Marshall even said that Swift pitched more jokes making fun of them, leading people to stop them on the street in real life and shout, "‘Hey, sad virgin!'" This is something Marshall said isn't even true, because "we're not sad."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1ln6Wyr7XNoGSmp56kubCz1J5krKeenHqktMCnnp6cXZ2ys3nCmqmenaJk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-truth-about-jack-dylan-grazer-s-girlfriend-morgan-cohen-and-their-pda-filled-romance.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Truth About Jack Dylan Grazer's Girlfriend Morgan Cohen And Their PDA-Filled Romance</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./seth-rollins-to-cody-rhodes-do-you-want-to-be-like-hulk-hogan-or-dusty-rhodes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Seth Rollins To Cody Rhodes: Do You Want To Be Like Hulk Hogan Or Dusty Rhodes?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
