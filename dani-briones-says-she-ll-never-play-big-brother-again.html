The nominations remained the same, and Dani was evicted by a vote of 4-0.</p><p>Following her eviction, Dani expressed surprise and major disappointment in her allies, namely Cody and Tyler. She is now one of the nine jurors who will vote for the winner on finale night.</p><p>Dani was interviewed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Weekly</a> following her eviction, and the Big Brother legend revealed that she'll never play the game again after this season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I will never play Big Brother again. I’m going to get emotional. I’m actually so sad because I knew I would never play again. I need a minute. I don’t want to cry. I knew I would never play Big Brother again and the way I went out hurt so bad. I am so sad that I didn’t get to do a lap around the house and take it all in because I’ll never go back there. I’ll never be back there. This is so silly. I started playing this game when I was 20 years old. I’m 34 years old. I’ve been there through three completely different parts of my life.</p><p>Whether I want to accept it or deny it. This game is a huge part of my life. I met my husband there. It’s a huge part of my life and I just wish I could have taken one last lap around the house and just soaked it all in. I did that many times throughout the game. I appreciate it so much. I’m so thankful. I’m so honored to have been asked. But no, I won’t ever do it again."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> "Big Brother" Legend Kaysar Ridha Sounds Off On All-Star Season, Eviction, Game Play</a></strong></p><p>Dani first played Big Brother 13 years ago in season eight.

She was sent home early in Big Brother 13 and Big Brother 22 for a reasons. Jeff and Tyler saw a major threat who could take them out at any time, and Dani's strong all-around game left her houseguests no choice.
