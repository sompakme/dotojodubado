At the time The Lumineers released their first album, their press release highlighted the fact that Schultz, then age 9, had been quoted in a 1992 story in The New York Times.</p><p>In that story (a profile of Dennis Kobray, who toured elementary schools imitating classical composers as a way to introduce children to classical music), 9-year-old Schultz is quoted as saying: “I spend a lot of time on my drawings and it turns out good ’cause I’ve been practicing a lot.”</p><p>Growing up in Ramsey, Schultz’s best friend was Josh Fraites. Fraites died of a drug overdose in 2002, at the age of 19. In the wake of Josh’s death, Schultz connected with Josh’s younger brother Jeremiah Fraites, a drummer, and the two “found solace in music, writing songs and playing gigs around New York.”</p><p>The two toured under various names including Wesley Jeremiah, and released a self-titled EP, including future The Lumineers songs, “Flowers In Your Hair” and “Darlene”. Frustrated by their band’s limited success in New York, and struggling with the high cost of living, Schultz and Fraites decided to relocate to Denver, where they could dedicate more time to working on their music and touring.</p><p>Upon arriving in Denver, they placed a Craigslist ad for a classical cellist. Neyla Pekarek responded to their ad and ultimately became the third member of The Lumineers. The trio spent the next year playing gigs around Denver and touring nationally at their own expense.</p><p>In 2012, The Lumineers released their first album, The Lumineers. Three songs from that album have charted: “Ho Hey”, “Stubborn Love”, and “Submarines”. In 2013, the band released a deluxe edition of their self-titled album.</p><p>In 2016, The Lumineers released the album, Cleopatra. The songs were written in the four years after the first album, The Lumineers was released. In 2019, The Lumineers released the album “III”. This is their third album. The album title references that the album is presented in three chapters, each focusing on a different main character of the fictional Sparks family</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=wesley-schultz-guitar-what-guitar-does-wesley-schultz-play></span><span>Wesley Schultz Guitar: What Guitar does Wesley Schultz Play?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wesley uses an Epiphone Century Electric Guitar.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=wesley-schultz-measurements-and-facts></span><span>Wesley Schultz Measurements and Facts</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Here are some interesting facts and body measurements you should know about Wesley.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=wesley-schultz-bio-and-wiki></span>Wesley Schultz Bio and Wiki<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Names:</strong> Wesley Schultz</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Occupation / Profession</strong>: Guitarist and singer</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: American</li><li><strong>Race / Ethnicity</strong>: White</li><li><strong>Religion</strong>: Christian</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=wesley-schultz-birthday></span>Wesley Schultz Birthday<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Age / How Old?</strong>: 37 years old</li><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: December 30, 1982</li><li><strong>Place of Birth</strong>: Ramsey, New Jersey</li><li><strong>Birthday</strong>: December 30</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=wesley-schultz-body-measurements></span>Wesley Schultz Body Measurements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Body Measurements</strong>: Not Available</li><li><strong>Height / How Tall?</strong>: Not Known</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: Not Known</li><li><strong>Eye Color</strong>: Not Available</li><li><strong>Hair Color</strong>: Blonde</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=wesley-schultz-family-and-relationship></span>Wesley Schultz Family and Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Father (Dad)</strong>: Not Known</li><li><strong>Mother</strong>: Not Known</li><li><strong>Siblings (Brothers and Sisters)</strong>: Not Known</li><li><strong>Marital Status</strong>: Married</li><li><strong>Wife/Spouse</strong>: Married to Brandy Schultz</li><li><strong>Children</strong>: 1 Son</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=wesley-schultz-networth-and-salary></span>Wesley Schultz Networth and Salary<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $3 Million</li><li><strong>Salary</strong>: Under Review</li><li><strong>Source of Income</strong>: Guitarist and singer</li></ul><h1><span>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Wesley Schultz</span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-wesley-schultz></span><span>Who Is Wesley Schultz?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born in Ramsey, New Jersey, Wesley Schultz is an American Guitarist and singer.
