Perhaps the only people more excited than <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a> about his role in Transformers: Rise of the Beasts are two of his celeb friends, <a href=#><strong>Megan Fox</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Machine Gun Kelly</strong></a>.</p><p>“When I told Colson and Megan, they laughed, they were like, ‘That’s sick.’ They were really stoked,” the <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> alum, 29, told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> at <a href=#>the film’s NYC premiere</a> on Monday, June 5.</p><p>Fox, 37 — who <a href=#>got engaged to Kelly</a> (real name Colson Baker), 33, in January 2022 — played Mikaela Banes in the film franchise’s first two installments, 2007’s Transformers and 2009’s Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.</p><p>The film — which premieres in theaters on Friday, June 9 — features Davidson as the voice of one of Primes’ (<strong>Peter Cullen</strong>) friends Mirage. Voicing the character was an experience the comedian called “really exciting” as he has been a fan of the franchise for years.</p><p>“I’ve been going to these movies forever. I’m freaked out. I can’t believe I’m talking to you, doing this thing,” the <a href=#>King of Staten Island</a> star told ET on the red carpet. “Bro, I’m full out of body here, so excited and just grateful. And everyone a part of it has been so nice. I’m just excited here.”</p><p>In May 2010, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> confirmed that Fox — who <a href=#>shares sons</a> Noah, 10, Bodhi, 9, and Journey, 6, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Brian Austin Green</strong></a> — would not return for the franchise’s third film, 2011’s Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Following reports that the actress was fired, a rep for Fox told Us that she “left on her own accord,” adding, “She wishes the franchise well.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pete-Davidson-Megan-Fox-Was-Stoked-About-My-Transformers-Role-inline.jpg><p>News of her departure came after she criticized the film’s director <a href=#><strong>Michael Bay</strong></a>. In addition to telling <a href=#>Wonderland</a> magazine that he was “a nightmare to work for,” Fox revealed to <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> that Bay, now 58, made her was his car as he filmed her during a Transformers audition — though she clarified in June 2020 that she was not undressed at the time and wasn’t made to do anything “that was extraneous from the material in the actual script.”</p><p>The Ambulance director, for his part, fired back at Fox’s initial comments by telling the <a href=#>Wall Street Journal</a> that the <a href=#>New Girl</a> alum still had “a lot of growing up to do,” adding, “You roll your eyes when you see statements like that and think, ‘Okay Megan, you can do whatever you want.’”</p><p>Her former costar <a href=#><strong>Shia LaBeouf</strong></a> joined in on the feud in a June 2011 interview with <a href=#>GQ</a>. “Criticism is one thing,” the Fury star, 36, <a href=#>told the outlet</a>. “Then there’s public name-calling, which turns into high school bashing. Which you can’t do. She started s—talking our captain.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Following her rise to stardom in the Transformers films, Fox went on to star in TV and film projects such as <a href=#>Jennifer’s Body</a>, This Is 40, and the <a href=#>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> films. She <a href=#>began dating MGK</a> in 2020 <a href=#>following her split from Green</a>, 49, earlier that year.</p><p>Two years before MGK popped the question to the Night Teeth star, he agreed that <a href=#>Davidson would make a good best man</a> if he and Fox were to ever get married. “Yeah, I’m down with that,” the “Emo Girl” singer said during a September 2020 episode of The Howard Stern Show after being asked if the <a href=#>Meet Cute</a> star would be part of his nuptials.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKeerJVisaLCyJ2qqKZdorKorc1mnaiwXayutHnSraaknZRirqO71K1kprFdqb%2BiutKfpqullafAbr7OpZxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shark-tank-s-barbara-corcoran-talks-alex-rodriguez-jennifer-lopez.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shark Tanks Barbara Corcoran Talks Alex Rodriguez, Jennifer Lopez</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-thurston-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mike Thurston Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
