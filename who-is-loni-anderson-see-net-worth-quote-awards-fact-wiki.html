Loni Anderson has been accumulating her net worth in the entertainment industry since 1975, although it should be noted that she was acting in films in 1966, too.</p><p>Is this actress rich? Estimations show that currently Loni Anderson’s net worth stands at $15 million, with the main source of her wealth coming from her acting career.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=loni-anderson-net-worth-15-million></span>Loni Anderson Net Worth $15 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>To give some background information, Loni Anderson was raised in the suburb of St Paul called Roseville, and was a student at Alexander Ramsey Senior High School, and then the University of Minnesota where she studied for a BA. She is Lutheran by faith.</p><p>In 1966, she debuted in the western film directed by Henry Hathaway “Nevada Smith” (1966) starring Steve McQueen, after which she didn’t appear on the screens as an actress for more than 10 years, but had small stage parts, and took on commercials too. Later, she acted in episodes of several television series including “S.W.A.T.” (1975), “The Incredible Hulk” (1978), “Three’s Company” (1978) and others, which helped her to become noticed, and invited to take the role in “WKRP in Cincinnati” (1978–1982), which casting made Loni Anderson famous, as well as increasing her net worth considerably. She added to her wealth when appearing in the television films “The Jayne Mansfield Story” (1980), “Sizzle” (1981), “Country Gold” (1982),&nbsp; “White Hot: The Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd” (1991) and “Without Warning” (1994) . More, she acted in the television series “Partners in Crime” (1984), “Nurses” (1993 – 1994), “The Mullets” (2003–2004), and eight episodes of “So NoTORIous” (2006) among over 30 TV productions in all, which have also helped her to add considerable sums to her net worth.</p><p>In addition to these, Loni’s appearances on the big screen in a variety of folms have also brought her revenues too; she had roles in the action film “Vigilante Force” (1976) directed and written by George Armitage, action comedy film “Stroker Ace” (1983) directed by Hal Needham, romantic comedy film “The Lonely Guy” (1984) directed by Arthur Hiller, comedy film “Munchie” (1992) directed by Jim Wynorski, martial arts film “3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain” (1998) and comedy film “A Night at the Roxbury” (1998) directed by John Fortenberry.</p><p>Loni Anderson added to her net worth and fame through releasing her autobiography – “My Life in High Heels” – in 1997.</p><p>Concerning her personal life, Loni Anderson has married four times and has two children. In 1964 she married&nbsp; Bruce Hasselberg, with whom she has a daughter; they divorced in 1966. In 1973, she married Ross Bickell but they divorced after eight years. In 1988, she married the actor Burt Reynolds with whom she adopted a son, but they divorced in 1993. In 2008, being 63 years old, Loni married the musician Bob Flick, who is a member of the band The Brothers Four.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Loni Anderson</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$15 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 5, 1945</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 5 in (1.676 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Voice Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>University of Minnesota</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Bob Flick (m. 2008), Burt Reynolds (m. 1988–1994)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Quinton Anderson Reynolds, Deidra Hoffman</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Maxine Hazel Kallin, Klaydon Carl “Andy” Anderson</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Loni Kaye Anderson</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000756</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Lifetime Achievement Award (2007, California Independent Film Festival)</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Golden Globe Awards, Primetime Emmy Awards, Outstanding Achievement Award (2016, LA Web Fest), Razzie Award (1984)</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Stroker Ace (1983), The Lonely Guy (1984), All Dogs Go to Heaven (1989), A Letter to Three Wives (1985), Sorry, Wrong Number (1989), Night at the Roxbury (1998)</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Cincinnati (1978–1982), S.W.A.T., Phyllis, Police Woman, Harry O, Three’s Company, The Jayne Mansfield Story (1980), Designing Women (1991), Easy Street (1986-1987), Nurses (1993-1994), So NoTORIous (2006)</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Deep sultry voice</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Voluptuous figure</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Large brown eyes</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Platinum blonde hair</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Title</th><th>Salary</th></tr><tr><td>WKRP in Cincinnati (1978)</td><td>$20,000 per 1/2 hour episode</td></tr></table><table class=quotes><tr><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Look up the definition of rejection in the dictionary, get really comfortable with it, and then maybe you can go into acting.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>I’m a real woman with a real heart and I have to live with a beautiful body and a pretty face which is not nearly as easy as it sounds.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>[on the paparazzi] They almost ran me off the road several times.
