While he did venture into comedy (including a memorable hosting stint on <a href=#><strong>Saturday Night Live</strong></a> where <a href=#>he was joined by Brendan Fraser</a>), the Virginia native also explored political drama as he found himself joining the cast of Aaron Sorkin’s political drama The West Wing.</p><p>The series went on to receive multiple Emmy nods and wins, but Lowe would later reveal that his time on The West Wing was toxic behind the scenes.</p><h2 id=rob-lowe-starred-in-the-west-wing-as-sam-seaborn>Rob Lowe Starred In The West Wing As Sam Seaborn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rob-lowe-in-the-west-wing.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Lowe first learned of The West Wing, he also knew that he wanted to play Deputy White House Communications Director Sam Seaborn. But despite his years in the business, he had to audition for the role.</p><p>However, Sorkin had been “determined not to cast him” at that time. While speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> for the show’s oral history, the hit showrunner explained that having a movie star take the role would just “throw the balance of the cast out of whack.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Pics Of Rob Lowe That Prove He Doesn't Age</a></span></p><p>Just the same, Lowe came in, prepared to perform three scenes for Sorkin.

But that’s exactly what happened. Following season 4, Lowe’s exit from the show was confirmed, with the star issuing a statement saying that he was “grateful” for his time on the show.</p><p>Warner Brothers Television and John Wells Productions (who produced the series) also released a statement claiming that Lowe’s exit was done “amicably.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Rob Lowe's Youngest Son Wants To Make The A-List Actor Do 'Darker' Things</a></span></p><p>As for Lowe’s Sam, the character was written out with the reveal that Sam had plans to run for office in his home district of Orange County.

It was alleged that the actor wanted a pay raise, but that was reportedly never granted.</p><p>While Lowe never confirmed this, he did previously remark that his eventual exit from the show was the result of him making a choice to either “stay static” or “invest in yourself.” The star also later reflected that staying on “would’ve been the worst thing” after Sorkin departed from the series (the showrunner also exited after season 4).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, Lowe later reunited with The West Wing cast once more for A West Wing Special to Benefit When We All Vote where they performed the stage version of the season 3 episode Hartsfield's Landing.

Jackson.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Rob Lowe Could Have Changed His Career Had He Accepted Patrick Dempsey's Role In Grey's Anatomy</a></span></p><p>Aside from taking part in the TV special, Lowe has also spoken openly about reprising his role again should The West Wing reboot happen. Over the years, Sorkin has said that he was open to doing it, but he’s not yet sure about what that would look like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As it turns out, Lowe has a suggestion, which is based on a scene in which Martin Sheen’s President Josiah Bartlet tells Sam that he will become the U.S. president one day. During an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC Radio 5 Live</a> in 2019, the actor teased that the said plot can be the storyline that kicks off the reboot. “Aaron Sorkin, hello, you wrote it. You came up with it. Already, let’s go,” Lowe even quipped.</p><p>Asked whether it would be strange to do a reboot now, considering everything that’s been happening in politics recently, Lowe did admit the show might “play out like science fiction today.” Although, that might be “just what the doctor ordered.” For now, there is still no confirmation on rebooting The West Wing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqbWmedaeqq1lp567qHnWmqpmrJ%2BttqR5xaipZqqfl3qtu9aeZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brittany-matthews-patrick-mahomes-celebrate-wedding-anniversary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brittany Matthews, Patrick Mahomes Celebrate Wedding Anniversary</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./15-teen-celebs-who-make-more-money-than-their-parents.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 Teen Celebs Who Make More Money Than Their Parents</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
