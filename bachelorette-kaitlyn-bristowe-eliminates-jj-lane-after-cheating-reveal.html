While the two divorced, Lane has been dedicated at co-parenting their 3-year-old daughter, <strong>Gemma.</strong></p><p>During his two-on-one date with Bristowe and<strong> Joe</strong>, Lane decided to come clean about this dark part of his past.</p><p>"I don't know where to begin," Lane told her during the cliffside excursion in Ireland. "The simple explanation is three years ago I cheated on my wife. Umm… I made a mistake that basically has destroyed my life. I lost everything. I lost my wife. I lost my daughter half the time. Everything I had worked hard for was gone with one bad, terrible decision."</p><p>Bristowe, 30, though appreciative of his transparency, felt in her gut that something wasn't right. "I'm not gonna lie," she told Lane. "That is my biggest fear in a relationship."</p><p>And his honesty backfired. "You know, I'm genuinely looking for a husband and someone to spend the rest of my life with. And that takes time," Bristowe said, clutching a single rose intended for one of the two men. "Joe, I don't feel like we've had that time, and JJ, you've got a beautiful daughter at home. I don't think it's fair for me to keep you here if I don't see a future with you. And it doesn't take away from how great I think you are. It's just what I'm feeling, and so I'm gonna have to say goodbye."&nbsp;</p><p>As she chose to send Lane home, Bristowe (surprise!) broke down in tears.&nbsp;"Hey, there's zero regrets," the Denver, Co., resident told her sympathetically.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After his elimination, Lane said leaving was "tough" for him. "I feel like I got blindsided by a semi-truck. Totally didn't expect to be standing here right now," he explained. "I just really want to find someone special. I want to share my life with them. I want to have a partner in crime. I want them to see how beautiful my daughter is."</p><p>Watch his emotional confession above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270Z6rrZ1doK6qwMuypWaaop7AtbvWnmSepJmitq%2Bt056qZqKaYrmiusRmmJ%2Bslad6pLTEmquippdiv6bCxJqjZmpgZoJ0fJVo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./capri-garnett-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Capri Garnett Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anya-chalotra-eye-is-dark-brown-in-color-everything-on-her-parents-and-ethnicity.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anya Chalotra Eye Is Dark Brown In Color: Everything On Her Parents And Ethnicity</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
