He worked on the 2017 crime film Good Time, the 2019 movie Uncut Gems, and the 2022 comedy Funny Pages. He was also an executive producer on Bodies Bodies Bodies, the horror movie starring <a href=#>Chase Sui Wonders and Pete Davidson, who recently broke up</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/why-is-sebastian-bear-mcclard-famous_-the-truth-about-his-life-before-marrying-and-divorcing-emily-ratajkowski.jpg><p>Since the allegations came out against Bear-McClard, it's safe to assume that he is no longer working in Hollywood. His last project was Funny Pages and there has been no news about him working on anything else.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Does Emily Ratajkowski Ex-Husband Sebastian Bear-McClard Have A Higher Net Worth Than Her?</a></span></p><p>It seems possible to assume that this scandal has impacted his net worth. Life & Style reported that he has a $12 net worth. This will keep him comfortable for a long time, and it means that he doesn't need to rely on an income from his film work. However, it does seem that people won't want to hire him because of his alleged behavior on movie sets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the last few years, Bear-McClard has seen many changes in his career. For almost ten years, he worked for the production company Elara Pictures. He started the company along with Ronald Bronstein, Benny Safdie, and Josh Safdie in 2014.</p><p>In August 2022, when he and Emily Ratajkowski had shared that they were getting divorced, Page Six reported that he was no longer working for Elara Pictures. Although he said that he wasn't working at the time because his mom was ill, Page Six reported that there were "complaints about his behavior" and he was let go.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/how-does-emily-ratajkowski-ex-husband-sebastian-bear-mcclard-have-a-higher-net-worth-than-her_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the months since the allegations, Sebastian Bear-McClard has kept a low profile. He doesn't post on social media or give interviews, and he has been quiet since he and Emily Ratajkowski got divorced as well.</p><p>In April 2023, The Daily Mail reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bear-McClard was in New York City</a>. The publication shared photos of him walking around the city with a woman, but the publication didn't mention her name.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Did Sebastian Bear-McClard Get After His Divorce From Emily Ratajkowski?</a></span></p><p>Since then, however, there haven't been any reports of Bear-McClard out in public. There is no information about what he is doing now, although people can assume that he lives in New York.</p><p>In August 2022, Page Six reported that his ex-wife Ratajkowski left the New York apartment that they were living in together and found another place to call home. According to Elle, she posted some Instagram Stories of her apartment so people could see what her space looked like. She has a huge green couch in the middle of the living room.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/emily-ratajkowski-sebastian-bear-mcclard.jpg><p>It's unclear if Sebastian Bear-McClard and Emily Ratajkowski have finalized custody or if he spends a lot of time with their son Sylvester. According to a story in The Daily Mail in April 2023, the former couple was photographed on the street where Ratajkowski lives with their child. That is at least one indication that he still sees his son at times.</p><p>Also in April 2023, The Daily Mail published another article with photos of Bear-McClard, Sylvester, and someone who the publication said is one of his pals. From these images, it seems that he has still been part of his son's life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the custody arrangement is a mystery at the time of this writing. That could mean that the former pair hasn't finished working it out yet, or it could mean that they have but they want to keep it private.</p><h2 id=did-sebastian-bear-mcclard-say-anything-about-the-allegations>Did Sebastian Bear-McClard Say Anything About The Allegations?</h2><p>Sebastian Bear-McClard has been silent since several news outlets reported on the allegations against him in the spring of 2023. He hasn't talked to any websites or publications since about the allegations or what he has been doing.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Was Emily Ratajkowski Jealous Of Sebastian Bear-McClard's Relationship With Suki Waterhouse Long Before Their Divorce?</a></span></p><p>A few others have shared their opinions on Bear-McClard, though. In August 2023, Benny Safdie, who directed Uncut Gems and who also created Elara Pictures, was interviewed by GQ.</p><p>He said, “When you find out something about somebody that you didn’t realize, you just have to be much more careful. It’s a lot, and it’s not something that you want to have happen to anybody. And when you find it out, the one thing that you can do is really just take control.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/emily-ratajkwoski-and-sebastian-bear-mcclard-at-the-2018-oscar-s-vanity-fair-party.jpg><p>In April 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily Ratajowski spoke about Sebastian Bear-McClard</a> in an interview with The Los Angeles Times. She said that she didn't want to talk about her former husband because that might mean that she wouldn't be able to keep taking care of her son. It was definitely tough for her fans to hear these comments as she sounded so upset.</p><p>Ratajkowski said, "I'm learning that outspoken women don't often get their children." She also said she had a "horrifying year" and was afraid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sebastian-bear-mcclard-at-the-la-premier-of-uncut-gems.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While he didn't talk to the media after his divorce or after the allegations came out, Ratajkowski's ex-husband is said to have hoped that they would get back together.</p><p>A source explained in an interview with Page Six in August 2022, “Sebastian is begging her to give him another chance. That’s not going to happen because she did her own digging and discovered even more s–t he did behind her back.”</p><p>Whatever Sebastian Bear-McClard is up to now, his ex-wife Emily Ratajkowski seems to be doing the best that she can to raise their son Sylvester.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYpaSVnK61tc6nqmaZl5a2r7%2FTZqqempGowaqtzWaZnpmiYrqkr8uaqZ1lkZuzpq%2FTZpqaqpWav26tzZ1kp52kYsSwvtOhZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kanye-west-seemingly-deems-himself-the-greatest-of-all-time.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kanye West Seemingly Deems Himself The Greatest Of All-Time</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ben-goertzel-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ben Goertzel Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
