During one song, Eminem would be heard demonstrating his boastful and angry side. Then, in the next song, Eminem could be heard demonstrating his softer side.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Eminem's devoted fans will already know, it is his children that most often bring out his softer side. As a result, many Eminem fans have long been fascinated by Eminem's relationship with his children.</p><p>Once the news broke that Eminem's daughter Hailie Scott was getting married, <a href=#>Eminem stayed silent</a>. Similarly, when it was revealed that his daughter Alaina Scott was marrying a man named Matt Moeller, Eminem didn't say a word publicly. That left fans wondering how Eminem feels about Moeller.</p><h2 id=who-is-eminem-39-s-daughter-alaina-marie-scott>Who Is Eminem's Daughter Alaina Marie Scott?</h2><p>From early on in Eminem's career, the world-famous rapper has been professing his love for his daughter Hailie Jade Scott. While fans have long known about Eminem's relationship with Hailie Scott, many of them have no idea the rapper has two other children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/eminem-s-daughters-hailie-jade-scott-and-alaina-marie-scott-recording-a-podcast.jpg><p>In April 2022, Eminem's youngest child Stevie Laine Scott was born. The biological child of Eminem's ex-wife Kim Scott and someone she dated after their first marriage ended, the rapper adopted Stevie when he married Kim Scott for the second time.</p><p>After Eminem and Kim Scott got divorced the second time, he remained a father to Stevie Scott who came out as non-binary when they were 20 years old.</p><p>Years earlier in February 1993, Eminem's eldest child was born. The biological daughter of Dawn Scott, the sister of Eminem's ex-wife Kim Scott, Alaina Marie Scott's mother tragically grappled with addiction issues.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Reason Eminem Might End Up Skipping His Daughter Hailey's Wedding</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During Eminem and Kim Scott's first marriage, the former couple adopted their niece and made Alaina Scott a part of their family. After Eminem and Kim Scott's second divorce, he told Rolling Stone in 2004 that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he had full custody of Alaina Scott</a>. Furthermore, Eminem remarked that Alaina Scott was "like a daughter" to him and described the role he had in her life.</p><p>"My niece has been a part of my life ever since she was born. Me and Kim pretty much had her, she'd live with us wherever we was at." That same year in 2004, Eminem rapped about Alaina Scott in his hit song "Mockingbird". "Lainey, uncle's crazy ain't he? / Yeah, but he loves you, girl and you better know it / We're all we got in this world."</p><p>While Eminem called himself Alaina Scott's uncle in that song, she has repeatedly referred to him as her father in the years since then. On Instagram, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminem's eldest daughter describes herself</a> as a "lover of travel", a "mental health advocate", and she makes it clear that "body positivity" matters to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-eminem-like-his-son-in-law-matt-moeller>Does Eminem Like His Son-In-Law Matt Moeller?</h2><p>In July 2021, Alaina Scott took to Instagram to celebrate her 7th anniversary with a man named Matt Moeller. "While my love for you has somehow grown over these last 7 years, one thing has remained the same - you are my favorite person. You are my best friend, the best fur dad, and the best partner. Thank you for loving me as effortlessly as you do. Happy anniversary, ILY❤️"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/alaina-marie-scott-and-matt-moeller-wearing-a-colorful-dress-and-suit.jpg><p>Only months later in December 2021, Alaina Scott announced that she and Moeller had gotten engaged. Since then, Eminem's fans and Alaina Scott's followers have learned very little about the man who is now a part of the rapper's family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pretty much the only things that are known about Moeller is that he is married to Alaina Scott, and he is 29 years old as of this writing. On top of that, there is no denying that Alaina Scott and Moeller seem extremely happy when they are photographed together.</p><p>The reason that so little is known about Moeller is that Alaina Scott's husband has never spoken to the press, and he doesn't seem to have a social media presence. As a result, Moeller hasn't said anything publicly about his father-in-law. Similarly, Eminem hasn't said anything publicly about Moeller or the fact that Alaina Scott got married.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Kim Scott Mathers Get Along With The Kids She Had With Eminem?</a></span></p><p>On June 9th, 2023, Alaina Scott and Moeller walked down the aisle. After the nuptials, Alaina Scott spoke to People about her wedding and revealed something that gave fans the first insight into the relationship Eminem likely has with Moeller.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While speaking to People, Alaina Scott revealed that she oversaw every aspect of her big day. “Our wedding was something out of a movie. I planned the entire thing, down to every last detail. Even customized napkins of our dogs with the phrase ‘Our parents are married!’ It's just very rewarding to see all your hard work come to life.”</p><p>Alaina Scott also revealed another detail about her wedding that would have been incredible for her guests to see. “We had 2000 white roses lining my aisle alone. It was magical.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/alaina-scott-and-matt-moeller-s-wedding-aisle-from-her-instagram.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it is fascinating to learn details like that about Alaina Scott's wedding, it is another detail she told People about that is most revealing. As it turns out, Alaina Scott and Moeller wouldn't allow most of her guests to bring anyone with them.</p><p>“Getting married is a sacred thing and we wanted to be surrounded by people who share in our daily lives. We did something super untraditional and didn't allow many plus ones. This was important to us.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Hailie Jade Thought Her Childhood Was Normal Growing Up, But Looking Back, She Realized It Wasn't</a></span></p><p>Since Alaina Scott was so careful about who she allowed at her wedding, the role her family had in the ceremony seems significant. On top of it being revealed that Alaina Scott's sister Hailie Jade Scott was her maid of honor, the bride thanked Eminem for making her wedding possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“These are once-in-a-lifetime moments and I'm just so grateful to be loved the way I am by everyone. None of this would have been possible without my Dad. I'm beyond blessed.” Also in the same People interview, Alaina Scott revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the active role Eminem played in her wedding ceremony</a>.</p><p>“I had an 80-ft long black and white checkered aisle and my dad walked me down the aisle. He wasn't going to miss that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/alaina-marie-scott-and-matt-moeller-wedding-day-photoshoot.jpg><p>In theory, Eminem could detest the man his daughter was marrying and still play a role in their wedding. After all, Eminem could put his love for his daughter over any negative feelings he could theoretically have for Moeller.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even while acknowledging that possibility, it is worth noting that it seems much more likely that Eminem is supportive of his daughter's marriage. After all, according to Alaina Scott's statements, Eminem not only walked her down the aisle, he is the one who made her wedding possible.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpqGemrq0edGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWSwoaSdeqWt1KCfrZ2iYq6trcinmGalkae2pnnSnKatrKNitba%2FwZqlnWWdlsG1ecyonKWklad8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./margot-robbie-s-barbie-hair-secrets-prime-day-deal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Margot Robbie's Barbie Hair Secrets: Prime Day Deal</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./iheartradio-music-festival-2023-everything-to-know.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>iHeartRadio Music Festival 2023: Everything to Know</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
