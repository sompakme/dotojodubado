I start hearing a ‘zzzz’ — like, a fly sound. Bro, I haven’t been able to find the f—king fly.”</p><p>Cardi said that she told her driver to go get a flyswatter and spray but saw no sign of an insect.</p><p>“Then, I start hearing this sound in the hallway. It sounds like somebody’s on the phone. So, I told one of the security guards guarding the house outside to …come inside to hear the sound,” she continued, claiming that she heard the noise for 15 minutes.</p><p>Once the guard came in, however the sound stopped. “Bitch, tell me how the sound is gone! It’s gone out of nowhere,” Cardi exclaimed.</p><p>“All I’m saying to you is that there’s a f–king ghost or spirit in this fucking house and what I don’t like about it is that the ghost be f–king with me,” she continued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cardi-B-Says-Her-LA-Mansion-Is-Haunted-by-a-Ghost-Who-Wants-to-Have-Sex-With-Her-01.jpg><p>“Because when <a href=#>Offset is in this house</a>, nothing ever happens! But, when I’m alone, it always wants to f–k with me. Mind you, when I’m in the house in Atlanta or New York, there’s nothing. But this house in L.A., it’s always some weird vibe when I’m here.”</p><p>Cardi said she’s ready to relocate to a hotel, declaring, “I’m f–king over it.”</p><p>Earlier this month, Cardi told “Big Boy’s Neighborhood” that there was “definitely a ghost” in her house. “There was this one time that I … like, I heard something,” she said. “I told one of the security [guards] to sleep inside the house. Yep, you gotta sleep [on] the couch because I swear to God, I hear something.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Recently, Cardi and Offset were in the news for a different scandal<strong>. <a href=#>Kenneth Petty</a></strong> — the husband of Cardi’s longtime rap rival,<a href=#><strong> Nicki Minaj</strong></a> — was <a href=#>placed under house arrest</a> for posting videos of him allegedly threatening Offset. A California judge ordered Petty, 45, to undergo home monitoring after he was allegedly “recorded on video making threatening remarks to a specific individual while in the company of someone with a criminal record.”</p><p>Petty was previously sentenced to three years of probation in July 2022 after pleading guilty to failing to register as a sex offender in California in 2020. Petty spent four years in a New York prison after being convicted in 1995 for the first-degree attempted rape of a 16-year-old girl.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmaKZtm6ujKyYsqtdnbyusYyiqmagkaq7tbHDZpmyZZedvLTAjLCfqGWnlru1v4ytpmagkauybr%2FEsWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./do-devin-booker-s-parents-actually-get-along-with-kendall-jenner.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Do Devin Bookers Parents Actually Get Along with Kendall Jenner?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bam-margera-news-us-weekly.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bam Margera News - Us Weekly</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
