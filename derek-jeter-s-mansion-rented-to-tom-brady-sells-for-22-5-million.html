The former professional shortstop and his wife, Hannah Jeter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sold their Davis Islands mansion</a> for a cool $22.5 million on Friday. Realty firm Smith & Associates, who handled the closing, confirmed the news to the media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tampa Bay Times</a>, the million-dollar listing, located at 58 Bahama Circle, is the most expensive real estate sale to happen in Tampa Bay. The Jeter family initially listed the home for $29 million last September, though it eventually sold for less than the original asking price.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Las Vegas Luxury Real Estate Advisors Make $25,000 Donation To Animal Care</a></span></p><p>However, before it was sold, the Jeters had been renting the property out to Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Brady</a> and his wife, supermodel <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gisele Bundchen</a>. The celebrity couple began renting out the mansion after relocating to Tampa Bay when Tom was signed to the Buccaneers. Smith & Associates noted that the couple was very accommodating to prospective buyers and had no problem with the realty firm showing the house while they lived there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom and Gisele, who have two children together, have seemingly already moved on to a new property. The power couple reportedly purchased land in Miami’s Indian Creek Island on which they plan to construct a new home. Tom and Gisele are living nearby while the house is being completed, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> confirms.</p><p>Since it was home to two sport legends, Smith & Associates&nbsp; explained they had to be selective in who they showed Jeter’s home to while it was on the market. They were apparently worried about fans requesting to see the property without being seriously interested in placing an offer. According to Tampa Bay Times, the team at Smith & Associates utilized background software to research folks who showed interested in viewing the home. This allowed them to determine if the prospective buyer(s) had enough funds to finance the purchase, thereby signalling if they were serious&nbsp; or not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jeter’s now-sold home is surely not lacking in amenities or space. The waterfront, walled estate sits on a 1.25 acre property and features a 22,000 square feet home as well as 345 feet of open bay. The mansion itself features seven bedrooms, eight full bathrooms, and eight half bathrooms. Some of its notable features include a full-service bar located in a club room, a wine cellar, a movie theater, a gym, a guest suite, and a six-car garage with air conditioning.</p><p>The outdoor amenities are just as impressive. The property features 9,000 square feet of covered outdoor areas, including porches and balconies. It also has a dock featuring two boat lifts as well as a heated spa and saltwater pool extending 80 ft.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luxury Real Estate Market Booms Due To Pandemic Lockdowns</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tampa Bay Times</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxpr7EpGSjnaSav265wKeqoqeeYsGwuYybqZqcqWLAprjLrGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./insurance-agent-paul-jones-in-albuquerque-nm-state-farm.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Insurance agent paul jones in albuquerque nm state farm</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ben-affleck-and-ana-de-armas-relationship-timeline.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas Relationship Timeline</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
