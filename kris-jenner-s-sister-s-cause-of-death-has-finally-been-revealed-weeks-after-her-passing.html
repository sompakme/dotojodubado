"No pictures of Karen and Kris together in the last 30 years or so says everything about their relationship," another wrote. Others have commented on how little had been said about Houghton, despite Jenner living much of her life in the public eye. "I don't recall Kris EVER even mentioning she had a sister," a comment reads. Another fan agreed, writing, "Not once has anyone mentioned her in all the years of filming and not one photo from the last what 20 years?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Why don't we ever hear about her sister????" one fan asked. While others responded with similar thoughts, some people were quick to shut down this line of questioning. "Maybe … just maybe ... it's none of our business," one response reads. Maybe she wanted to lead a private life. Sending thoughts and prayers for you because you were left in the dark." It is true that Houghton preferred to live her life away from the spotlight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiiq6GjYremus2eqWarmajBpr7SZpuemaSdeqSt1KycZp6Zo66tuNhmqZ6ulZa5prCMsJyeo6NirqfAxKtkqZmjqLavs44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swift-s-red-carpet-style-evolution.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swift's Red Carpet Style Evolution</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joao-felix-net-worth-how-much-is-felix-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joao Felix Net Worth How Much is Felix Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
