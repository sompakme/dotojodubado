Having her by my side is such an honor,” Haley gushed to&nbsp;<i>Us.&nbsp;</i>“She has helped me so much that I’m almost sure nothing would have been accomplished without her. I’m very picky to the point where I can’t decide on things and she has kind of been able to bring me down to earth and help me make really tough decisions when it comes to planning.”</p><p class=p1>In addition to Emily — who <a href=#>got engaged to hockey player <strong>William Karlsson</strong> in December 2020</a> — Haley and the Finland native were joined by 75 guests, including Bachelor Nation alums <a href=#><strong>Amanda Stanton</strong></a> and<a href=#> <strong>Lauren Bushnell Lane</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>“It’s so so amazing to have Amanda and Lauren be here for my wedding day,” Haley said. “I know they both will have to travel to make it, so it means a lot to me to have them there for this special day. I have always remained close to Lauren and Amanda post-show. They were my closest friends while filming and I have loved watching both their love stories unfold.”</p><p class=p1>For her part, Stanton, 32, <a href=#>announced her engagement to <strong>Michael Fogel</strong></a> in December 2021, while Bushnell Lane, 32, <a href=#>wed country singer <strong>Chris Lane</strong> in October 2019</a>. The pair, who share 12-month-old son <a href=#>Dutton</a>, announced earlier this month<a href=#> they are expecting their second child</a>. Besides Stanton and Bushnell Lane, Haley and her now-husband were <a href=#>surrounded by their loved ones on Saturday</a>, who were surprised by the decor and a special appearance.</p><p class=p1>The newlyweds arranged for an<a href=#> Elvis Presley</a> impersonator to perform for their guests “because it’s Vegas and you have to” while they all <a href=#>munched on late-night McDonald’s snacks</a>.</p><p class=p1>The “Twinning at Life” podcast cohost <a href=#>previously announced in May 2021</a> that Palve had popped the question.</p><p class=p1>“We had been talking since October 2019 and then I flew out to New York to&nbsp;spend Christmas with him&nbsp;and I knew that trip he was the type of guy you marry,” Haley <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>later that month about her man</a>. “He surprised me with tickets to&nbsp;<i>The Lion King</i>&nbsp;on Broadway and wined and dined me. He was so kind and thoughtful, and I just got to know who he was as a person.”</p><p class=p1>She added at the time: “I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us and where his hockey career will take us. I also can’t wait to plan a wedding with him and celebrate with his family in Finland.”</p><p class=p1>As the twosome planned their dreamy nuptials, Haley jointly celebrated <a href=#>both her bachelorette party</a> and<a href=#> bridal shower alongside her twin</a>. However, the&nbsp;<i>Twins: Happily Ever After&nbsp;</i>alums declined to throw a double wedding.</p><p class=p1>“We did think about it for a second but mostly just laughed at the idea,” Haley joked to&nbsp;<i>Us</i>&nbsp;in June, just&nbsp;before her big day. “That’s why we decided to combine everything else … but for the wedding we both wanted to have that special moment to ourselves!”</p><p class=p1>Leading up to the romantic ceremony, Palve, for his part, was <a href=#>“feeling good” about finally becoming Mr. and Mrs.</a></p><p class=p1>“I’ve been a little anxious leading up to the wedding and he said he only feels stressed for me because he wants it to be everything I’ve dreamt of,” Haley said, noting she plans to take his last name once they’re legally wed. “So he’s been my support system during all the planning! He’s so excited to call me his wife and wear a wedding band!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>She continued: “[Me,] I’m feeling good, definitely overwhelmed with a lot of different emotions but overall excited. I’ve had all the feels recently because we’ve been planning for a year and it’s all about to happen! A lot of anticipation leading up to the big day so I’m trying to take a step back and just soak it all up! I cannot wait to be Mrs. Palve.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to see photos from the happy couple’s wedding day:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwamxjJuYnKCVobyzv4yhmKWdqWKzpr7Grqqopl2irrO%2ByJ6qZqeloa5uvMClrZ5lp5qxpbXNoGSpoJ%2BpvLR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-simpsons-the-financial-success-of-animation-s-royal-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Simpsons: The Financial Success Of Animation's Royal Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sophia-turner-youtuber-net-worth-how-much-is-derek-deso-s-wife-making-a-year.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sophia Turner Youtuber Net Worth, How Much Is Derek Desos Wife Making A Year?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
