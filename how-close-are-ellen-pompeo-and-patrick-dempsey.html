Both Ellen and Patrick worked alongside one another for a total of 11 seasons however, rumors began swirling when Dempsey left the show that the two didn't always get along. Ellen referred to her work environment as "toxic" the year Dempsey left, leading fans to believe things weren't always rainbows and sunshine on set.</p><p>Luckily, after clearing her statement up, it was revealed that she and Patrick got along great, despite not having spoken to one another since 2015. With that many years under their belts, we're certain things got complicated when it came to their relationship, but it appears as if they always have each other's backs. With all that being said, here is everything we know about Patrick Dempsey and Ellen Pompeo's friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-were-one-of-the-most-beloved-on-screen-couples><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Were One Of The Most Beloved On-Screen Couples</span></h2><p>When it comes to the world of TV medical dramas, there are a number of shows that come to mind, however, one remains supreme. "Grey's Anatomy", which first aired back in 2005, introduced one of the most beloved on-screen couples to date. Whether you are a fan of the show or not, there is no denying the power than Meredith Grey and Derek Shepherd had as a couple. Fans adored these two together and looked forward to their evolving romance every single week.</p><h2 id=the-two-worked-together-for-over-a-decade><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>The Two Worked Together For Over A Decade</span></h2><p>Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey both signed on to "Grey's Anatomy" from the get-go, and in addition to being two of the most beloved characters, they have also become two of the longest-running characters, that is up until Dempsey's departure from the show. Patrick, who left after Season 11, spent over a decade alongside Pompeo, so not only were they one of the best on-screen couples, but they spent a whopping 11 years doing it so brilliantly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pressure-from-fans-to-date-in-real-life-got-to-them><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Pressure From Fans To Date In Real Life Got To Them</span></h2><p>If there is one thing that remains true is that we would love to see Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey date in real life. This is often the case with television characters, where fans wish they were witnessing a real-life romance, however, this was simply not the case for Ellen and Patrick. Despite the two being good friends and colleagues, it appears as if the constant pressure from fans to date in real life became an annoyance for both actors, which we certainly don't blame them for.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grey's Anatomy: These Facts Leave Fans Scratching Their Heads</a></span></p><h2 id=however-the-two-haven-t-spoken-since-dempsey-s-departure><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>However, The Two Haven't Spoken Since Dempsey's Departure</span></h2><p>While both Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey worked alongside one another for 11 years, the two have not spoken in quite a bit. After Dempsey's departure from "Grey's Anatomy" back in 2015, he and Pompeo said their goodbyes and meant it. Ellen claims that she has not spoken to Patrick since he left the show, which created a plethora of rumors surrounding their relationship and whether they got along all those years or not. Although the two worked together f0r quite a while, perhaps they never truly got along.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ellen-referred-to-her-work-environment-as-toxic><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Ellen Referred To Her Work Environment As "Toxic"</span></h2><p>During Ellen Pompeo's time on the hit ABC show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she referred to the work environment and being on set as extremely "toxic".</a> While Pompeo did not specify exactly what rendered the work environment as such a toxic place, many readers and fans of the show began to speculate if she was referring to Patrick Dempsey. The star made the "toxic" statement the very year that Demsey had left the show, which led fans to believe that she was referring to him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Went On Behind The Scenes Of "Grey's Anatomy"?</a></span></p><h2 id=but-assured-fans-she-was-not-referring-to-patrick><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>But Assured Fans She Was Not Referring To Patrick</span></h2><p>After receiving a lot of questions, concerns, and even some backlash regarding her statement about a "toxic" work environment, Ellen Pompeo had to settle things once and for all and ensure fans of the show that she was not talking about Patrick. While the timing may have been off, considering Dempsey had just left "Grey's Anatomy", Pompeo had nothing but great things to say about her co-star and friend and apologized for the misunderstanding that her comment may have created, especially to those who have been watching the show since the very beginning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=patrick-claimed-he-amp-ellen-had-a-magical-bond><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Patrick Claimed He & Ellen Had A "Magical Bond"</span></h2><p>When it came time to ask Patrick Dempsey about his experience working on "Grey's Anatomy" and acting alongside Ellen Pompeo, the star has nothing but great things to say about her. Dempsey, who played Ellen's&nbsp;love interest throughout 11 seasons of the show, referred to his relationship Pompeo as being a "magical bond". The two got on great and any rumor that claims otherwise is absolute nonsense. Patrick Dempsey put all rumors to rest with this one statement, leading fans to sigh in relief over news that essentially pinned these two actors against one another.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Things About Meredith & Derek's Relationship That Never Made Sense</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dempsey-s-salary-was-much-higher-than-ellen-s><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Dempsey's Salary Was Much Higher Than Ellen's</span></h2><p>When it comes to working on a television show with an ensemble cast, chances are the main characters who share the same amount of screentime and storylines are expected to be making the same amount of money, however, that wasn't the case for Ellen and Patrick. According to Ellen Pompeo, for the first three seasons of the show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrick Dempsey was making double what she was, yes, double! </a>Not only was Meredith the "star" of the show, but she had the most screen time and lines to learn, all while making less than her male counterpart. Luckily for Pompeo, she is now racking in $20 million per year, which is one of the highest salaries for a television star in history.</p><h2 id=the-two-have-since-gone-on-to-marry-other-people><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Two Have Since Gone On To Marry Other People</span></h2><p>Despite Meredith and Derek being some of our favorite television couples, in addition to some of the greats such as George and Louise, Ross and Rachel and Lucy and Ricky, the two are in committed relationships with other people in real life. Ellen Pompeo has been married to her hubby, Chris Ivery, since 2007, and Patrick Dempsey has managed to rekindle his relationship with ex-wife, Jillian Fink. While we, much like the fans, would have loved to have seen Meredith and Derek be a thing in real life, we are happy to see them happy with other people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ellen-still-plays-our-favorite-television-doctor><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Ellen Still Plays Our Favorite Television Doctor</span></h2><p>After taking the lead on one of the best medical drama shows in television history, fighting for equal pay, and dealing with non-stop relationship rumors, Ellen Pompeo, who plays Meredith Grey, remains our favorite on-screen doctor to date. The show is currently in its &nbsp;16th&nbsp;Season, which is the 8th longest-running scripted show in primetime television history and does not appear to be going anywhere anytime soon. If there is someone who has taken on a character and executed it perfectly, it is without a doubt, Ellen Pompeo.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Grey's Anatomy Actors, Ranked From Jerk To Sweetheart</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmLmwv8RmmKudXZq5rbHNZqeopaCavG6tzZ1kqZmkp7akt4ydnKaoo5rGcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ray-liotta-s-only-daughter-karsen-is-picking-up-the-pieces-of-her-life-after-her-father-s-tragic-dea.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ray Liotta's Only Daughter Karsen Is Picking Up The Pieces Of Her Life After Her Father's Tragic Dea</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dean-graziosi-bio-age-height-career-net-worth-education-affair-wife-salary-ethnicity-relig.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dean Graziosi Bio, Age, Height, Career, Net Worth, Education, Affair, Wife, Salary, Ethnicity, Relig</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
