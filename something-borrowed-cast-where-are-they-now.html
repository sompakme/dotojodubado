Something Borrowed captivated audiences in 2011 — and more than 10 years later, viewers are still rooting for a sequel that would tell more of Rachel and Darcy’s complex stories.</p><p>The <a href=#>rom-com</a>, which was based on <a href=#><strong>Emily Giffin</strong>’s book</a> by the same name, starred <a href=#><strong>Ginnifer Goodwin</strong></a> as Rachel and <a href=#><strong>Kate Hudson</strong></a> as her BFF Darcy. While the women are thick as thieves when the film begins, things are much more complicated by the end.</p><p>In the film, Rachel sleeps with Darcy’s fiancé, Dex (<a href=#><strong>Colin Egglesfield</strong></a>), whom she has been in love with since law school. As the duo tries to keep their love for each other under wraps, tension builds between Rachel and Darcy. Meanwhile, Darcy is having her own affair with their mutual friend Marcus (<a href=#><strong>Steve Howey</strong></a>).</p><p>In the end, the truth comes out. Darcy admits that while<a href=#> she “hates” her once best friend</a>, she also cheated and is now pregnant. Before credits roll, <a href=#>Darcy runs into Rachel</a> and learns that she is still dating Dex. The two women wish each other well and part ways.</p><p>While the onscreen drama boiled over — and left fans with a cliffhanger after pregnant Darcy flew to London to stay with Rachel’s pal Ethan (<a href=#><strong>John Krasinski</strong></a>) — off camera the cast dynamic was fun and stress free.</p><p>“We got along immediately. We became friends, the moment we met. We’re both girl’s girls. Neither one of us is competitive with other actresses,” Goodwin told <a href=#>Collider</a> in May 2011 of Hudson. “We have the same life priorities, so as different as we may be, we’re exactly the same in the most important ways, so we became fast friends. That part wasn’t difficult. We never had to work on representing the chemistry between us.”</p><p>Despite the film’s messy ending, viewers can’t get enough of Rachel and Darcy, so much so, they are holding out for Giffin’s book Something Blue to become a feature film.</p><p>“It’s really happening soon. <a href=#>The script is in such great, great shape</a>,” the author teased of the movie sequel to <a href=#>PopSugar</a> in July 2016. “They did a fourth version of it. I wrote the first, and then the production company hired this amazing husband-wife team, and they have a really great dynamic that’s almost like the banter between Ethan and Darcy. They brought such perspective to it but were still really true to the characters. It’s so funny.”</p><p>Unfortunately, the second film has not been made as of 2022. If the movie does get greenlit down the road, both Goodwin and Egglesfield are ready to return to New York City and reprise their roles, assuming they are asked back.</p><p>“She’d have to <a href=#>write another book</a>!” Goodwin told Egglesfield on a January 2022 episode of his <a href=#>“Coffee with Colin” YouTube series</a>. “We are a lot older, Colin! We look great, but we are a lot older than those characters are supposed to be.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Once Upon a Time alum</a> reflected on the success of the first film as well, noting that fans can’t stop talking about it.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I kind of can’t believe its longevity. Like, I still get stopped for that movie a lot. People tell me it’s their favorite movie a lot. Or I get the texts up the wazoo when it’s suddenly, like, I don’t know, on TV. It’s a top streaming thing or whatever,” she added. “And I don’t know how we haven’t gone back and revisited it. Maybe it would even better now because there’s been like this absurd break between one and two.”</p><p>Scroll down to see what the actors have been doing since the rom-com’s premiere:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BovK6x06Ggp59dl7yzvs6wnJ1lk5bAtXnWoZyrnV2Wv6Z506GcsmWepMRw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./agnes-moorehead-cause-of-death-how-did-agnes-moorehead-die.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Agnes Moorehead Cause of Death, How did Agnes Moorehead Die?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bridgerton-season-3-clip-shows-penelope-flirting-with-colin.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Bridgerton Season 3 Clip Shows Penelope Flirting With Colin</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
