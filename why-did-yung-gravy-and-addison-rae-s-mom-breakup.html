The pair appeared to be in full couple mode, as they packed on the PDA for the cameras. The red carpet date came a month after the pair were seen being flirtatious over social media.They were certainly an unexpected couple, and <a href=#>reports say that Addison was “embarrassed” her mom</a> was seeing a much younger man. But the romance fizzled out, as it was reported by October 2022 the two had broken up.So, what went wrong between Yung Gravy and Sheri?

He was allegedly having affairs with women – around the same age as his social media famous daughter.</p><p>One of his mistresses, Renee Ash, spoke to <a href=#>Page Six</a> about their affair. She says Monty told her his marriage to Sheri was over. But Renee broke up with him after she discovered he was seeing other women at the same time.</p><p>“Unfortunately, he misled me on his marriage, he lied to me,” Renee said. “I loved him, and I believed him. When I found out about the other young girls, my heart broke.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sheri subsequently released a statement, implying her marriage to Monty was over.</p><p>“<a href=#>Personal matters being brought</a> public are always challenging and overwhelming for anyone involved,” she said. “I will be okay. My biggest concern is -and always will be- my children and their fragile hearts and minds. I will always do my best to protect them.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Shocking Things The Hadid Family Wants You To Forget</a></span></p><p>Monty and Sheri went on to finalize their divorce by November 2022.</p><p>But Sheri was linked to Yung Gravy mere weeks after Monty’s cheating was exposed. The timing seems to suggest she was using him as a rebound and/or a way to distract the public’s attention.</p><h2 id=yung-gravy-might-ve-wanted-a-career-boost-according-to-rumors>Yung Gravy Might've Wanted A Career Boost, According To Rumors</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that Yung Gravy seemed like a rebound for Sheri, it’s not surprising the romance didn’t last. She’s likely still reeling from the divorce and possible not looking to settle down.</p><p>For Yung Gravy, the rapper also doesn’t seem interested in a serious commitment. He was likely interested in romancing Sheri because she fits his brand – he’s admitted to liking older women. Many of his songs mention having a preference for “MILFs.” For example, in “Mr. Clean,” he raps, “<a href=#>I’m with your mom in the kitchen</a>, makin’ blueberry muffins.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>12 Celebrities Who Are Rumored To Be Rude IRL</a></span></p><p>Yung Gravy is also just up-and-coming in the music publicity.

But that’s not the only evidence the relationship was never meant to be long-term. Sources swear it was all one big PR stunt.</p><p>In August, a source told <a href=#>Page Six</a> the two had faked their red carpet appearance, saying, “It’s a PR relationship. It’s kissing, but it’s not real.” The insider added that Sheri isn’t the rapper’s type. In fact, his references to liking older women are just part of an act and he prefers women closer in age to himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Yung Gravy swears he’s still on good terms with Sheri and that they even communicate.</p><p>“<a href=#>We still keep in touch a lot</a>,” he said in late October. 2022 “It wouldn’t make sense for us to date because we live in different cities, but we keep in touch. Any show I have in Louisiana, she’ll be there.”</p><p>He also said that he didn’t expect people to assume he and Sheri were dating when he took her to the VMAs in August.</p><p>“When I brought [Easterling], everyone was instantly like, ‘Oh, they’re dating.’ Tons of rumours started about her and I being pregnant and all this stuff,” he explained. “We had been flirting online, I wanted a cute first date and I thought, ‘Let’s do this.’ I guess that’s not how it works with these fame type people.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether it was a PR stunt or a short-lived flirtation, there’s no evidence to suggest Yung Gravy and Sheri were ever in it for the long haul.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalediupaBll6eut8WMmpudoaOku26%2BwJ6qZqWfonqjvsSaoq6oXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./offset-laughs-off-nicki-minaj-s-husband-s-apparent-street-threats.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Offset Laughs Off Nicki Minaj's Husband's Apparent Street Threats</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-loni-anderson-see-net-worth-quote-awards-fact-wiki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Loni Anderson?
