Timothée appeared subdued during promotion for Dune: Part 2, earlier in the week, or at least that’s what fans think so.</p><p>Photographs from the event captured the actor alongside his co-star Zendaya, 27, on the red carpet in Seoul, South Korea. <a href=#>Both donned matching leather jumpsuits</a>, with Zendaya in pink and Timothée in gray, accentuated by a waist belt. Fans couldn't help but interpret Timothée's demeanor (and outfit choice) as reflective of a potential split from Kylie, further fueling speculation about the couple's relationship status. At the very least, there were questions over whether Kylie was alright with Timothee rocking a amtching look with his co-star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Zendaya and Tim Tam promoting Dune in Seoul, South Korea, wearing matching outfits.

Where is her matching outfit with her man?" one person wrote in a Reddit thread, while another chimed in,"Timothée looks kinda tired and fed up lmao."</p><p>Allegations of relationship problems between Timothee and Kylie have been circulating for weeks. They intensified over Valentine’s when it seemed like the couple spent the romantic holiday apart, though it would’ve been their first time celebrating. Kylie showed off the gifts she got for her two kids, whom she shares with her ex Travis Scott, but some fans speculated why Kylie hadn’t gotten anything for Timothee.</p><p>There have also been reports that not only is Timothee <a href=#>growing tired of Kylie’s luxurious lifestyle</a>, but she’s also imposing strict rules on him. One report claimed <a href=#>Kylie insists on knowing Timothee’s passwords</a> and is apparently suspicious of his exes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For now, Kylie and Timothee are refusing to directly comment on the speculation about what’s going on between them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYq6zsYycpqeumaOwprCMpLCloZVit6a6zZ6pZpmemXq1tcyoq6GdlWKwqa3LmqSerF2Wv6Z5zq%2Bcq2WRm8Gmvoysn55lo52us7HSZpqlrZVitq95zZ6uZqifqMFw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./firing-away-at-growing-niche-markets.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Firing Away at Growing Niche Markets</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./corey-feldman-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Corey Feldman Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
