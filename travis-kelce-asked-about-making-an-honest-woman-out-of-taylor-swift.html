It’s just us guys here,” <strong>Jason Sudeikis</strong> asked during a sketch at the Big Slick Celebrity Weekend charity event in Kansas City on Saturday, June 1, per <a href=# rel=noopener>social media</a> footage. “When are you gonna make an honest woman out of [her]?”</p><p class=p1>Kelce, 34, sat across the table from Sudeikis, 48, and was seen laughing and smiling at the joke.</p><p class=p1>“Taylor doesn’t need to be working anymore. And again, I know your kicker agrees with me,” Sudeikis joked, referring to <strong>Harrison Butker</strong>’s controversial graduation speech about women giving up careers to be homemakers. “He gets it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Travis-Kelce-Asked-About-Making-an-Honest-Woman-Out-of-Taylor-Swift-03-2024.jpg><p>Travis Kelce; Inset: Taylor Swift</p><p class=p1>Sudeikis and his fellow panelists continued to poke fun at Kelce’s romance with Swift, 34, before the Kansas City Chiefs tight end silenced their line of questioning.</p><p class=p1>“Guys, you’re really pushing it,” Kelce sarcastically replied.</p><p class=p1>Kelce has been dating Swift since summer 2023. Despite nearly reaching their first anniversary, they are not currently planning a wedding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Travis-Kelce-Asked-About-Making-an-Honest-Woman-Out-of-Taylor-Swift-01-2024.jpg><p class=p1>“Travis has <a href=#>no plans on proposing</a> to Taylor anytime soon,” a source exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i>in May. “It’s not even on his radar. Marriage is something he takes very seriously and not something he would ever just jump into without giving it some careful consideration.”</p><p class=p1>That being said, Kelce does care “very deeply” about Swift but isn’t ready to get down on one knee just yet, according to the insider.</p><p class=p1>A second source previously told <i>Us </i>in January that Kelce and Swift “<a href=#>still have so much to learn</a> about each other” before walking down the aisle.</p><p class=p1>“Travis and Taylor have no plans on getting engaged this summer,” the source explained at the time. “Things between them are going amazing, but they haven’t even been together for a year yet.”</p><p class=p1>Kelce and Swift have fueled engagement speculation throughout the spring as she dropped several songs on April’s <i>The Tortured Poets Department </i>about their romance and he joined her on the road. The pop star kicked off the European leg of her <i>Eras Tour </i>last month in Paris, which Kelce attended.</p><p class=p1>“Taylor’s shows are unbelievable,” Kelce <a href=#>exclusively gushed to <i>Us </i></a>at his Kelce Jam festival later that month. “If you haven’t been to them, you got to try it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Kelce has attended several of Swift’s overseas concerts between his work commitments.</p><p class=p1>“He <a href=#>wants to support her as much as he can</a> while he can, so he’s going to [go] back and forth from the U.S. to Europe while he has the time,” a third source told <i>Us</i> in May. “For now, [Travis] can arrange his schedule to be with [Taylor].”</p><p class=p1>Kelce is currently in his NFL offseason but recently began <a href=#>team OTA practices</a>. The Chiefs kick off the 2024-2025 season on September 5 with a home opener against the Baltimore Ravens.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5yp6jnJ1dlsCsscNmmJunpal6rq3KoqWgZZGjeqm7zZ6qrWWnpLqiuoyorK1ln5t6ta3YpaarZaOstqfAjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wendie-malick-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wendie Malick Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-wardrobe-secrets.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swift Look What You Made Me Do Wardrobe Secrets</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
