In a separate post, a video shows The Rock gifting the black vehicle to Tamina, once again celebrating her accomplishments in the caption.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Life as a pro wrestler is very hard,” he wrote. “It can be very rewarding, but it can also tax your soul.”</p><p>The Rock continued, “Life as a female pro wrestler and being a single mom, trying your best to raise two daughters while being on the road, all year around - FOR YEARS […] I salute you cuz.”</p><p>The Rock’s generous gift to his cousin comes a little over a week after he shared a video of himself <a href=#>surprising his mom with a new house</a>. The clip showed his mom tearing up as she walked through the fully furnished house for the first time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I surprised my mom and bought her a new home,” the caption read. “Took me and my design team 8 weeks to get it ready, where she could walk thru her front door for the very first time and everything she saw was brand new and a total surprise.”</p><p>The Rock added that he’s bough his mom “a few homes over the years,” but he hopes that this will be her forever home.</p><p>The actor originally bought the Cape Cod-style home for $3.48 million in September of last year. The Rock worked with a team of interior designers to furnish and decorate the home before presenting it to his mom.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Shaquille O'Neal Covers Bill For An Entire Restaurant (& It Was Pricey)</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TalkSport</a>, <a href=#>Instagram @TheRock</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmadr5Guu6Z506GcZqqfmLhuts6hpaynnmLAtr7Pq6CsnaNiurC5jJymrquZo3qpu9SsnKxn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-josh-swickard-dating-josh-swickard-girlfriend-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Josh Swickard dating?
