Gregg Allman was born December 8, 1947 in Nashville, Tennessee. He is best known as a founding member of the Allman Brothers Band. He began his career in music as a teenager, playing in several groups with his older brother Duane before The Allman Brothers Band came to fruition in 1969. The band hit the charts in a big way in the early ’70s. Gregg Allman made the charts in 1986 as a solo artist with I’m No Angel. He was inducted, along with the band, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. When Allman was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame on September 16, 2006, he was introduced by Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue and performed Oncoming Traffic, Melissa and Georgia on My Mind solo and then ended with Midnight Rider backed by fellow inductees Bill Berry, Peter Buck and Mike Mills from R.E.M. at the Georgia World Congress Center. His distinctive voice placed him in 70th place in the Rolling Stone list of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. Gregg Allman continues to work with The Allman Brothers Band, minus Duane Allman who lost his life in 1971 in a motorcycle accident in Macon, Georgia. Greg Allman died on May 27, 2017 at the age of 69.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fnL%2Bms8ZmmKWknZa7tHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5waKmoKqRpbW6ecWamq1lk5a%2FprHRZpiwmaKZwG6tzZ1kpaGWmnq0wM6rsGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hawkshatesyou-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hawkshatesyou Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./from-sports-to-politics-10-pro-athletes-who-became-politicians.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>From Sports to Politics: 10 Pro Athletes Who Became Politicians</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
