The smile that Jimmy beamed at you from the stage was sparked by your spirit. I think that’s why he loved performing so much,” she added. “He was so grateful to the community you built around him. Your sympathy and support inspire and comfort me and my family.”</p><p>Buffett <a href=#>died on September 1</a> following a private four-year battle with <a href=#>Merkel cell carcinoma</a>, a rare skin cancer that can <a href=#>spread quickly</a> to other parts of the body. In her statement, Slagsvol thanked “the teams of doctors, nurses, hospice workers, and caregivers” who cared for Buffett.</p><p>“Your compassion was overwhelming in the best possible way,” she noted. “Jimmy listened to everything you said and followed your every order. You gave him hope, even at the most hopeless moments. Thank you for your tenacity in seeking the best solutions at each stage of his illness. You were honest, brave, and empathic; you showed us such dignity and goodness. I could not have asked for a better team of professionals.”</p><p>Slagsvol added that she felt “fortunate” — as did Buffett — for the tight-knit group of “honorable” and “generous” people they worked with over the years. “You made our lives better in thousands of ways, big and small, each day. That was especially true during these last few years,” she wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Jimmy-Buffett-Wife-Jane-Slagsvol-Addresses-His-Death-2.jpg><p>Her message of gratitude continued with a nod to her and Buffett’s friends. “You created a microclimate of affection that surrounded us like the sun. It gave us hope; it felt like a celebration even when things were grim. It’s a balm to me now,” she said. “Without your friendship, we surely would have fallen. I wish each of you has friends as gracious, generous, and kind.”</p><p>Despite his health battle, Slagsvol asserted that <a href=#>Buffett was still “filled with joy”</a> in his final days. “He smiled all the time, even when he was deeply ill. And his sense of humor never wavered,” she wrote. “Jimmy was always the optimist, always twinkling, always making us laugh.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After noting that she would forever be “unfathomably grateful” to her family for their support, Slagsvol referred to Buffett’s song “Bubbles Up,” one of the last he recorded. “Jimmy knew he was loved. Right until the end, he looked for the light. Thank you for giving joy to him and to me,” she concluded.</p><p>Buffett and Slagsvol <a href=#>tied the knot in 1977</a>, five years after his split from first wife <strong>Margie Washichek</strong>. The “Margaritaville” singer and Slagsvol welcomed daughters <strong>Savannah</strong> and <strong>Sarah Delaney</strong> in 1979 and 1992, respectively, and adopted son <strong>Cameron</strong>. Buffett and Slagsvol separated in the early 1980s before reconciling in 1991 after she got sober.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajoZ2ixm6u1J%2BdnqykqHq4tcWeZKOZnpp6tLjAoKqvp5xirqWw0Z6qrJ2jYrWqv4ydnJqsmGKzsL6MaqqtZaSeuqZ7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./julia-hart-wins-tbs-championship-at-aew-full-gear.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Julia Hart Wins TBS Championship At AEW Full Gear</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-whitmore-jr-net-worth-age-height-weight-family-wiki-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>James Whitmore Jr. Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
