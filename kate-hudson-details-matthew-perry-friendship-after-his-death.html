In the snap, Hudson let out a big laugh, presumably in response to something Perry had said.</p><p>“As you can see, to know him was to adore him,” Hudson continued. “I send my love and condolences to his family and his work families. We love you Matthew.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kate-Hudson-Details-Friendship-With-Matthew-Perry-2.jpg><p><a href=#>Perry was found dead</a> at his home in Los Angeles on Saturday, October 28, after authorities responded to a call about a possible cardiac arrest. He was 54.</p><p>There were no signs of foul play at the scene, but the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner said that <a href=#>Perry’s cause of death</a> has been “deferred” following <a href=#>the initial autopsy</a>. A toxicology report is still pending.</p><p>The Los Angeles Fire Department confirmed on Monday, October 30, that <a href=#>Perry was already deceased</a> when first responders arrived at the scene. “A bystander had brought the man’s head above the water and gotten him to the edge, then Firefighters removed him from the water upon their arrival,” a spokesperson for the LAFD told CNN in a statement. “A rapid medical assessment, sadly, revealed the man was deceased prior to first responder arrival.”</p><p>LAFD spokesperson <strong>Nicholas Prange</strong>, meanwhile, told Page Six that firefighters “didn’t perform CPR” on Perry after arriving at his residence “because he was already beyond medical help.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Days after Perry’s death, his former <a href=#>Friends</a> costars — <a href=#><strong>Lisa Kudrow</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Courteney Cox</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>David Schwimmer</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Matt LeBlanc</strong></a> — paid tribute to the actor <a href=#>in a joint statement</a>. Perry starred alongside the group <a href=#>as Chandler Bing</a> throughout the sitcom’s entire run from 1994 to 2004.</p><p>“We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew. We were more than just cast mates. We are a family,” the actors told Us Weekly on Monday. “There is so much to say, but right now we’re going to take a moment to grieve and process this unfathomable loss.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaSaeqnBw6ymp2WUmsGitcusZKaZpKm1psOMqZyrqqlis7O1xKebrKCZpXqistOeqWagmah6pbHArZ9o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./oded-fehr-is-married-to-wife-rhonda-tollefson-kids.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Oded Fehr is Married to Wife: Rhonda Tollefson.
