I would hope so. I mean, I may not have toured much, but, like I said, the creative part jumps out every now and then,” Jackson, 64, said on the Tuesday, February 21, episode of the “<a href=#>In Joy Life</a>” podcast, which is hosted by daughter <strong>Mattie Jackson</strong>. “I’m always scribbling down ideas and thinking about melodies and I feel like there’ll be some more music to come, yes.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The country crooner shared how he prefers songwriting over touring, which is “kind of like you’re just doing the same thing over and over.” Making an album, however, scratches Alan’s creative itch.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“It’s a challenge, so it keeps you interested a little more. If I didn’t write, I think I would’ve gotten bored just singing a long time ago,” he explained to the 32-year-old Lemons on Friday author.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The “Livin on Love” singer has struggled to make music<a href=#> since being diagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease</a>. Alan has battled the condition — a hereditary disorder that affects the nervous system, causing progressive loss of muscle tissue and loss of sensation in the arms and legs — for over a decade but didn’t go public with the news until September 2021.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“I have this neuropathy and neurological disease,” the Georgia native shared during a <a href=#>Today show</a> interview at the time. “It’s genetic that I inherited from my daddy. … There’s no cure for it, but it’s been affecting me for years. And it’s getting more and more obvious.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">While CMT doesn’t shorten life expectancy, it can make movement extremely difficult — especially for a person used to performing on stage night after night.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“I’ve been reluctant to talk about this publicly and to my fans,” the “Chattahoochee” singer explained when revealing his battle with the disorder, which also affected his grandmother and sister. “It’s called CMT, ironically enough, because CMT was a big part of my career.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">After revealing his diagnosis, the “Little Bitty” crooner announced that he planned to continue touring, but <a href=#>he didn’t want to call it a “farewell” outing</a>. “I never wanted to do the big retirement tour, like people do, then take a year off and then come back,” he told <i>Today </i>host <a href=#><strong>Jenna Bush Hager</strong></a>. “I think that’s kinda cheesy. And I’m not saying I won’t be able to tour. I’ll try to do as much as I can.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Despite his health issues, the <a href=#>Country Music Hall of Fame inductee</a> set out for his Last Call Tour in March 2022, sharing in a statement that he would continue to play music for “as long as my health will allow.”<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span>However, he was forced to postpone two tour dates in October 2022.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“I hoped I’d be able to be there,” the statement read. “I hate to disappoint my fans. I tried as much as I could to play this show at this time.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_p4 x_ContentPasted0"><span class="x_s1 x_ContentPasted0">For now, Alan is enjoying his downtime at home&nbsp;</span>— and watching his grandson, Jackson, grow up. The little one is the “Good Time” artist <a href=#>and wife<strong> Denise Jackson’s</strong> first grandchild and was born</a> in December 2022 and is the son of&nbsp;<span class="x_s1 x_ContentPasted0">daughter <strong>Ali Jackson</strong> and husband<strong> Sam Bradshaw</strong>. (Alan and Denise, 63,<a href=#> also share daughter</a> <strong>Dani Jackson</strong>.)</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“Our whole family is all joyful for our new grandbaby, our first grandbaby. … My first boy in the family,” Alan gushed about the newborn on Tuesday’s podcast. “I had four older sisters and three daughters and so this is a new experience.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapJGjequtwqSqqKZdpbmiutJmnaiqXaK8s7GMpqysoZNiwbB5wqiknmWRoraleceemKWsmGLAtb7UoJ6lnaNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alexa-bliss-believes-her-match-with-ronda-rousey-can-headline-summerslam.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alexa Bliss Believes Her Match With Ronda Rousey Can Headline SummerSlam</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./puff-daddy-ft-sting-prazwell-s-roxanne-lyrics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Puff Daddy ft.
