He also would have won the Rookie of the Year award if it hadn’t been for his quarterback Dak Prescott who just nudged him out for the honor.</p><p>In a video posted on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a> website previewing the issue, Zeke talks about how his abs get a lot of attention and, with a smile on his face, says “I feel like, you know, I’m going to lose some mojo if I lose my abs.”</p><p>While Elliott is rightly proud of his abs, softball star A.J. Andrews has no problem pointing out – also with a smile - that she has, “A really ripped back.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Andrews is a great athlete and an incredible outfielder, playing for the fast pitch Akron Racers. She is also the first woman ever presented with a Rawlings Gold Glove.</p><p>Also making an appearance in the 2017 Body Issue is tennis player&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Caroline Wozniacki</a>, who for a couple of years starting in 2010 was the number one ranked female tennis player in the world. At the same time, she did find her name mentioned less in relation to her tennis playing and more because of her relationship with Golfer – and ex-fiancé - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rory McIlroy</a>.</p><p>But, after ending 2015 ranked 17th in the world and 2016, 19th, she has been playing better lately and her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">current WTA ranking</a> is 8th.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress><p>This isn't the first time Wozniacki will have posed for a popular annual issue of a magazine as she was also featured in both the 2016 and 2017 issues of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issues.</p><p>A few of the other athletes featured in the upcoming Body Issue&nbsp;are Boston Celtics All-Star point guard <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah Thomas</a>, MMA fighter Michelle Waterson, Julie Ertz of the U.S. women’s soccer team and her husband, Philadelphia Eagles tight end Zach Ertz, and the first breast cancer survivor to appear in the Body Issue, Jamaican 4-time Olympic track and field medalist Novlene Williams-Mills.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>HOTTEST WOMEN FROM THE SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT ISSUE</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcLHZnqKinZxisq24yKirrWWTlr%2BwuMinnGavn6%2B7qq3CpKBmmZpirq%2Bw0Z6urGWeqrGmecSsp6dlkqSxunnIrKqunV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./former-nxt-star-hoho-lun-explains-why-he-requested-his-wwe-release-and-talks-a-possible-return.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Former NXT Star HoHo Lun Explains Why He Requested His WWE Release and Talks a Possible Return</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./angie-stone-bieber-join-nick-cannon-for-teennick-premieres.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Angie Stone, Bieber Join Nick Cannon For TeenNick Premieres</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
