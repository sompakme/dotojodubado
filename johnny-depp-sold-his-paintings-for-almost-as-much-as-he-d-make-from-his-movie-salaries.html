A fact that has solidified him as a bona fide star and A-list actor. Given his time in the entertainment industry, Depp commands quite a sum to appear in a film. More often than not, that figure is in the neighborhood of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$20 million with 20% of the backend</a>. As a result, Depp has amassed a tidy fortune for himself with a "$150 million net worth."</p><p>What many do not know is that Depp's creativity is not limited to the big screen. Of course, he is quite the musician as a member of the Hollywood Vampires. But what many do not know about The Pirates of the Caribbean star, <a href=#>who did not always love the time on the set of the films</a>, is that he also enjoys expressing himself via a paintbrush.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fact that Depp was an artist was recognized by fans shortly after he won the defamation suit against his ex-wife, <a href=#>Amber Heard</a>. This was because the Edward Scissorhands star announced that he was going to auction off his art, with the proceeds going to charity.</p><p>Castle Fine Art, a gallery based in the United Kingdom, cooperated with Depp to host the online auction of his work. The gallery's website failed less than 20 minutes later due to the overwhelming number of would-be customers, and within a few short hours, all of Depp's art had sold for a pretty penny with fans admiring the talent he had in the process.</p><p><strong>Updated August 2023:</strong> After rumors swirled that Johnny Depp was done portraying the role of Captain Jack Sparrow because of a falling out with Disney, it appears that the door may not be completely closed.</p><p>While Depp has not signed on to anything as yet, Jerry Bruckheimer, who is scheduled to direct the next installment of the <a href=#>Pirates of the Caribbean franchise</a>, said the "future is yet to be decided."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Cast Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Currently, Depp is busy promoting his latest film, 'Jeanne du Barry' and preparing to direct his second feature film, 'Modi', starring none other than Al Pacino.</p><p>Though there are not any tour dates listed for Hollywood Vampire, Depp continues to play with his band and has no desire to put that creative interest behind him.</p><p>Where Depp's art career will lead is anyone's guess. But based off of the reception he has received, it would not be unheard of for more art to be available for purchase in the future.</p><h2 id=how-much-johnny-depp-made-from-selling-his-paintings>How Much Johnny Depp Made From Selling His Paintings</h2><p>Given the speed with which Depp's artwork sold, it is not surprising <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">millions were made from the paintings</a>. Many who were able to grab a painting were thrilled. Others, however, were disappointed they did not and wished there was more to purchase.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depp made over $3.6 million from the unexpected online sale of his debut art collection called Friends & Heroes. Those who purchased the prints were able to buy just one or a set of four.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/6-2.png><p>Each image is an intimate reflection of their character in Johnny's eyes; a portrayal of how they have revealed themselves to him," Castle Fine Art explained. "From his dear friend Keith Richards, who inspired the mannerisms of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow, to Bob Dylan, whose creative influence on the artist is seen in his vivid and immortal portrayal by Johnny."</p><p>The individual prints went for $3,973 and the set sold for $15,040 a piece, all of which expressed a feeling Depp wanted to explore while he painted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Johnny Depp May Be A Completely Different Man After Beating Amber Heard In Their Defamation Trial, Here's The Truth About His Life Now</a></span></p><p>"I've always used art to express my feelings, and to reflect on those who matter most to me, like my family, friends and people I admire," Depp explained via a statement from the gallery. "My paintings surround my life, but I kept them to myself and limited myself. No one should ever limit themselves."</p><p>Many of these emotions were being felt while going through the trial with Heard, and painting was a cathartic outlet Depp used to face the courtroom on a daily basis.</p><h2 id=johnny-depp-reached-creative-catharsis-during-the-lawsuit-with-amber-heard>Johnny Depp Reached Creative Catharsis During The Lawsuit With Amber Heard</h2><p>For nearly two months, Depp and Heard were a part of a media circus, which critics believe will turn into an <a href=#>encore performance for Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie</a>, also known as the defamation trial against Depp. During this time, Depp was not acting and needed a way to express himself. While some of that may have been through music, art was clearly what not only <a href=#>helped Depp escape</a> but also helped keep him focused on the end game which was winning the trial.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar52728084-1.jpg><p>"For many years, I really held myself strictly to just the day job of the film business, even though in my heart and forever I’ve been a musician, and I’ve always needed to escape into a blank piece of paper, whether it be writing, drawing or painting a blank canvas," Depp explained.</p><p>He went on to say, "My paintings surround my life, but I kept them to myself and limited myself. No one should ever limit themselves."</p><p>As such, in the days after the seven-person jury reached their decision to award Depp nearly $10 million in damages, of <a href=#>which he donated,</a> he announced his auction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>Did Amber Heard Cause The Break Up Between Johnny Depp And Vanessa Paradis?</a></span></p><p>It is not clear if Depp had intentions of always auctioning off the art. Perhaps, he wanted a creative fresh start after the trial ended and felt it best to release the artwork he did to the masses for the greater good. That greater good was a donation of money to Depp's favorite charities.</p><h2 id=will-johnny-depp-act-again>Will Johnny Depp Act Again?</h2><p>Given the support that Depp received from his first art collection, there have been rumors that he would like nothing more than to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">turn his back on Hollywood and live a life of an artist.</a> While part of this is true, given Depp has said he has "no further need for Hollywood," Depp wants to continue to explore all the creative outlet he can, maybe just not in front of the camera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I don't feel boycotted by Hollywood, because I don't think about Hollywood," Depp explained. "It's a strange, funny time where everybody would love to be able to be themselves, but they can't. They must fall in line with the person in front of them. If you want to live that life, I wish you the best."</p><p>Depp went on to say that said despite that sentiment, he has no plans to leave filmmaking for good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar52888304-1.jpg><p>"I've had about 17 comebacks apparently," Depp stated. "I keep wondering about the word 'comeback' because I didn't go anywhere. As a matter of fact, I live about 45 minutes away."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Depp has in mind is directing</a>. And while he has done this one other time in the past with the film, The Brave, Depp will have his hands full with his upcoming film, Modi, starring some A-list actors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film "follows a chaotic series of events through the streets and bars of war-torn Paris in 1916," telling the story of Amedeo Clemente Modigliani. Cast in the title role is Riccardo Scamarcio and Pierre Niney will play fellow artist Maurice Utrillo.</p><p>Depp also confirmed that Al Pacino will be in the film, portraying Maurice Gangnat.</p><p>In addition to directing, Depp has been spending a lot of time playing with Hollywood Vampires. However, a tour had to be postponed briefly after Depp suffered a bone fracture.</p><p>As soon as he was better, Depp joined the band in July 2023 and went on the road for several gigs throughout the US.</p><p>While Depp may not be done with acting forever, currently, his interests are lying elsewhere. But like all artists, it is necessary to express emotions and it is likely that when he is ready, Depp will make his way back to the big screen for audience enjoyment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIyjpqGmnq56pbHPqapmqJGeu7W1zaBknKejqXquu9WinGarkaGus8WO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mel-gibson-struggling-to-keep-up-with-son-lars-4-amid-quarantine.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mel Gibson Struggling to Keep Up With Son Lars, 4, Amid Quarantine</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-kim-restell-make-latest-kim-restell-net-worth-income-salary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Kim Restell Make?
