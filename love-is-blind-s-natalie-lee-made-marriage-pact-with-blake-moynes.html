Yeah, we might have to push that back,” Blake, a guest on the episode, quipped.</p><p class=p1>Natalie was ultimately willing to compromise on age 37 for the date of their pact.</p><p class=p1>Natalie and Blake first became friends after their respective stints on reality TV. Natalie was briefly engaged to Shayne Jansen during <i>Love Is Blind </i>season 2, which aired in 2022. After calling off her engagement, she sparked dating speculation with Blake.</p><p class=p1>Blake previously appeared on<strong> Clare Crawley</strong> and<strong> Tayshia Adams’</strong> split season of <i>The Bachelorette </i>in 2020 before getting engaged to Katie Thurston the following season. The Bachelor Nation star went with Natalie <a href=#>on a conservation trip</a> to the Caribbean island of St. Kitt’s in July 2022.</p><p class=p1>“I had never been on an animal conservation trip before and then I didn’t know [Blake], like I didn’t watch any of the seasons of <i>The Bachelorette </i>that you were on,” Natalie said on Thursday. “I had heard things about you through social media. I mean, like, good things … but I was like, ‘I don’t know, this is kind of weird that I’m going with him.’”</p><p class=p1>She continued, “But, I’m so glad I did because you are one of my favorite people. … I feel like the reason why I was so drawn to you is because we share the same sense of humor, like, I’m very self-deprecating [and] you can take it.”</p><p class=p1>During the getaway, Blake and Natalie had a short-lived fling.</p><p class=p1>“Yes, the answer is we did date,” Natalie added before Blake noted they were “set up” by their mutual agencies.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>But once they met, the pair had an effortless connection.</p><p class=p1>“It really took the first conversation with [Natalie] to feel like, ‘OK, this is someone that I could get along with or would be down [to meet],” he recalled.</p><p class=p1>Neither Blake nor Natalie explained why their fling fizzled out. He later tried to find love on <i>Bachelor in Paradise </i>season 9 in 2023 but left single after breaking up with fellow constant<strong> Jessica Girod</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalp6aaeqq%2FjJujoqaUqHqvrdOao6KdXaGypnnMmpueZZ2Wv7O1wKCcZqiRmMFuw8itn2aanJa4pnnMqLCnnaNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nascar-driver-sheldon-creed-is-married-to-cami-parsons-meet-the-couple-on-instagram.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>NASCAR Driver Sheldon Creed Is Married To Cami Parsons Meet The Couple On Instagram</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lady-gabriella-windsor-s-luisa-beccaria-wedding-dress-pics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lady Gabriella Windsor's Luisa Beccaria Wedding Dress: Pics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
