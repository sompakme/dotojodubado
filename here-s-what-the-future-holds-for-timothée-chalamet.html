While his earlier roles saw the young actor act primarily in independent films such as Miss Stevens and Call Me By Your Name, Chalamet has since gone on to star in some pretty huge blockbusters such as Dune and The French Dispatch. But what’s next for the talented young actor? Let’s take a look at what the future holds for Chalamet.</p><h2 id=he-started-acting-at-a-young-age><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Started Acting At A Young Age</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nowadays, Chalamet is widely recognized by audiences worldwide and praised as one of the most impressive young actors of our time. However, what many may not know is that Chalamet has actually spent a pretty long time developing his career and talents to get to the place that he is now. The 26-year-old began acting as a child in television commercials before securing a place in the prestigious LaGuardia Performing Arts High School where he graduated from in 2013.</p><h2 id=he-started-acting-on-stage><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Started Acting On Stage</span></h2><p>During his high school years in the performing arts academy, Chalamet was involved in several on-stage productions. While speaking to Vanity Fair, Chalamet’s high school drama teacher Harry Shifman reminisced about<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Chalamet’s high school performances</a> and even detailed a few failed auditions of the now Academy-Award nominated actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shifman stated, “Well, Timmy—he auditioned for Hairspray and Guys and Dolls, and I didn’t cast him, but I did cast him as one of the male leads in Sweet Charity. He played Oscar. There’s a very famous scene where he’s trapped in an elevator [with Charity], and I guess he’s kind of claustrophobic.” Adding, “I have to tell you something: in my entire life, and I’m in my mid-sixties, I have never seen a more brilliant comic performance [than] Timmy gave in that scene.”</p><h2 id=and-made-his-screen-debut-in-2009><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>And Made His Screen Debut In 2009</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the young actor worked on his craft and technique while attending high school, Chalamet was also able to break through as a screen actor before graduating from high school. In 2009, at only 13 years of age, Chalamet made his on-screen television debut in an episode of the iconic Law And Order. Chalamet portrayed the character of Eric Foley in the tenth episode of the show’s nineteenth season titled “The Pledge”.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Model Sarah Talabi Comes Clean About Timothee Chalamet Rumors</a></span></p><h2 id=his-first-film-was-in-2014><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>His First Film Was In 2014</span></h2><p>Despite making his on-screen debut in 2009, it took Chalamet five years after that to secure his first-ever official film debut. While the Hell’s Kitchen-raised actor had done two television films prior, it was his role in the 2014 coming-of-age film Men, Women & Children that marked his first official film role. In the film, Chalamet portrayed the role of Danny Vance and acted alongside his LaGuardia schoolmate, Ansel Elgort.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=but-he-garnered-recognition-for-this-role><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>But He Garnered Recognition For This Role</span></h2><p>Following his film debut in 2014, Chalamet went on to acquire several minor roles in other big hitters, such as his role as Tom Cooper in the Academy Award-winning film Interstellar. However, it was Chalamet’s role in the 2018 independent Luca Guadagnino film, Call Me By Your Name that earned the young actor critical acclaim. In the Academy Award-winning film, Chalamet portrayed the leading role of Elio Perlman, a cultured teen who comes of age during the summer in which he also comes to terms with his flourishing sexuality after meeting a handsome postgraduate (Armie Hammer).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-will-continue-to-lead-this-cinematic-franchise><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Will Continue To Lead This Cinematic Franchise</span></h2><p>Back in 2021 Chalamet hit a career high when he was cast to lead the cinematic revival of the massive Dune franchise. Based on the best-selling 1965 novel by Frank Herbert, the story had been previously adapted for the screen way back in 1984 with the iconic David Lynch directing the feature and Twin Peaks star Kyle MacLachlan taking on what is now Chalamet’s role of Paul Atreides. Following the success of the first film, Chalamet will continue to lead the franchise with the next installation set to be released in November 2023.</p><h2 id=he-will-reunite-with-luca-guadagnino-in-this-romance-thriller><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Will Reunite With Luca Guadagnino In This Romance Thriller</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another upcoming release that is fast approaching for Chalamet sees the young star reunite with his Call Me By Your Name director and friend, Luca Guadagnino, for a dark romance feature. Based on the 2015 Camille DeAngelis book of the same name, Chalamet will be starring alongside Lost In Space star Taylor Russell in the upcoming Bones And All adaptation set to be released in November 2022. During the 2022 Venice press conference for the film, Chalamet explained how the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> film’s concept of being an extreme outcast resonated in today’s digital age</a>.</p><p>The actor stated, “But I think it’s tough to be alive now, societal collapse is in the air – it smells like it. Without being pretentious, that’s why, hopefully, these movies matter. That’s the role of the artist, or so I’m told - to shine a light on what’s going on.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The One Movie That Timothee Chalamet Regrets Making</a></span></p><h2 id=he-will-be-donning-an-iconic-top-hat-in-this-upcoming-film><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Will Be Donning An Iconic Top Hat In This Upcoming Film</span></h2><p>One future role of Chalamet’s that will be more lighthearted yet equally iconic and fantastical as the previously mentioned roles, is Chalamet’s future as the famous chocolatier in the upcoming Wonka musical film. Starring alongside some pretty huge names such as Matt Smith, Rowan Atkinson, and Olivia Coleman, Chalamet will be donning the iconic top hat and taking on the mantle of Willy Wonka. The Paul King feature is set to be released just in time for Christmas of 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZK2glWKztsDUq5xmoJ%2BhsbR5xaipZqyZory1tMRmmqGZnJa6psCO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kathy-wakile-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kathy Wakile Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./guy-fieri-has-a-tattoo-as-a-tribute-to-his-late-sister-what-exactly-happened-to-morgan.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Guy Fieri Has A Tattoo As A Tribute To His Late Sister What Exactly Happened To Morgan?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
