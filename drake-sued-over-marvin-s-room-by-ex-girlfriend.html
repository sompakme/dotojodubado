During that time, Drake had allegedly agreed to collaborate on the song, asking Lee to record the hook and intro.<br></span></p><p>“Plaintiff’s contribution is highly significant to the overall work,” says the complaint.</p><p>According to the complaint, there are text messages that Drake supposedly sent to Lee, saying, “U basically made that song” and “It’s sh*t without you.” <span>The Toronto native also offered Lee 2 percent of publishing royalties.</span></p><p><span>In July of 2011, Lee was given credit as a “vocalist” on the song as a “Syren Lyric Muse” and the recording was registered at the U.S. Copyright Office. </span>On July 11, she filed a claim, saying, “My works and voice are used on this work.”&nbsp;About six weeks later, Drake’s record label, Cash Money Records rebutted with its own claim stating that the song authored was an “employer for hire.”</p><p>Lee reports that her relationship ended and got ugly after the song was released. By November, Lee hired lawyer Neville Johnson, who previously filed a lawsuit against Drake on behalf of Playboy Enterprises for an unauthorized sample the rapper had allegedly used for “Best I Ever Had.”</p><p>The complaint states that Lee’s decision caused Drake to make threatening phone calls, saying “What the f–k is your problem?” He then offered her “4-5%” of publishing compensation plus $50,000 to go away.</p><p>This time, Drake might have to be the one to do better. –Adelle Platon</p><p><strong>UPDATE: Drake’s camp has released a statement refuting these claims.</strong></p><p><span>“This claim is entirely without merit and our client has not engaged in any wrongful conduct. Ericka Lee consented to the use of her voice in the song “Marvin’s Room” prior to its release. Lee asked only for the credit she received as “Syren Lyric Muse,” and she did not ask for any compensation. It was only after she retained a lawyer that there was a demand for payment. &nbsp;Drake tried for months to resolve the matter amicably, and he now looks forward to being vindicated in court.”</span></p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6q9pa3TnptmnKKWuKZ50q6cnWWfq7Kzecyaqa%2Bhnqh6s7vOpmSesF2ctrO4xaugnqaUYoR2hJhuZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elle-macpherson-looks-powerful-in-a-cape-on-the-red-carpet.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Elle Macpherson Looks Powerful in a Cape on the Red Carpet</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-brown-and-ex-karrueche-tran-slam-each-other-in-instagram-feud.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Brown and Ex Karrueche Tran Slam Each Other in Instagram Feud</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
