When asked about all of the crazy things he used to do during The Attitude Era, Steve Austin reflected upon the time he drove the beer truck into the arena and hosed down The Rock prior to WrestleMania 15.</p><p>“It was a pretty wild time,” Stone Cold Steve Austin admitted. “And a lot of times, you get creative the day of. So I just remember arriving at the building, and then Vince or somebody said, ‘Hey, man, we’re gonna have you drive a beer truck into the arena, and you’re gonna get to hose down The Rock,’ and out of that beer truck, I bumped a rating with it. But you know, the first 30 gallons that came out was actual beer, and then it turned into water. So when you show up, and you hear all the crazy shit that they’ve had me do, whether it was Zambonis, beer trucks, driving cement trucks filling out a Corvette with cement.</p><p>“We were able to do so many fun things that it’s those moments that people will never forget. And that beer truck was one of them. And as I stood on top of that beer truck, delivering the go-home promo for Rock for Wrestlemania 15, that was a hell of a night at the office, and people just shit their pants because you just don’t see that every day. And that’s the kind of stuff that we were doing on damn near every Monday night. We’re doing something off the wall, and that’s why the ratings were so high, and that’s why — well, I gotta get a lot of credit to the roster, but we had a loaded roster with a lot of great creative, and we were just on a tear.”</p><p>Steve Austin went to talk about a talent that he has to be able to learn to drive big vehicles in a matter of minutes, be it a Zamboni or a cement truck.</p><p>“It was quite a spectacle,” Austin said. “And I’ve always told anybody I don’t know why I had this talent. But from driving monster trucks, I learned how to drive a monster truck 15 minutes before we went on live TV. You know that Zamboni, a guy showed me how to run it. That cement truck that had those fold-down levers, they didn’t have a mark for me to hit. When when you’re on live TV and the red lights on. I’m your guy. And so just being able to come through at crunch time and always deliver the goods has always been something that I’ve prided myself on when it comes to live TV and working with the WWE.”</p><p>Austin also spoke about the likelihood he shows up at WrestleMania 39 next year, which you can read about at .</p><p>What do you make of Stone Cold Steve Austin’s comments?
