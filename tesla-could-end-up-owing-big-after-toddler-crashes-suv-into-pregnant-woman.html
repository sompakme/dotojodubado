the plaintiff's version of events:</p><p>► In a trial brief, Tesla's attorneys wrote: "The evidence will prove that Ms. Harcourt was the sole cause of her injuries and that sophisticated driver assistance features in the Model X saved her and her children from far more serious injuries ...";</p><p>► Per the brief: "Ms. Harcourt negligently left her two-year-old son unattended in her driveway with access to a vehicle that had two doors open and the keys inside, and for long enough to allow him to get into the vehicle, step on the pedals, and put it into gear ...";</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>► Harcourt then "made the highly extraordinary decision to jump in front of the Model X as it was moving ... this entire incident could have been avoided by either keeping watch over the toddler, or, failing that, using the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PIN-to-Drive option</a> ...";</p><p>► Per the brief: "Ms. Harcourt admits she did not know where her son was at this time, but when she saw the Model X moving into the garage, she — at 8 months pregnant — nonetheless stepped in front of the vehicle, now claiming she believed that would make it stop ...";</p><p>► Per the brief: "In no uncertain terms, Ms. Harcourt's own actions caused her injuries, and not any defect in Model X's design ...";</p><p>► Per the brief: Harcourt's "poor decisions...put herself, her son, and her unborn child at significant risk ...";</p><p>► Tesla's attorneys concluded that the Model X "functioned exactly as designed, and very likely saved Ms. Harcourt's life."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img
