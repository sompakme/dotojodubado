However, he persevered, <a href=#>driven by his love for comedy</a> and his desire to make people laugh. Despite being deserted by both his parents at an early age, he was raised by his maternal grandmother, Benita Gutierrez, a factory worker, and step-grandfather, Refugio Gutierrez, a construction worker and attended San Fernando High School, graduating in 1979, and that was where he first discovered his love for comedy.</p><p>In 1993, Lopez married Ann Serrano, and they welcomed a daughter, Mayan, in 1996. Despite their long and loving relationship, they decided to end their marriage in 2010, citing irreconcilable differences. Though <a href=#>he was raised Catholic</a>, George is not religious but he does believe in God. Despite the challenges he's faced in his personal life, he has become one of the most beloved comedians and actors of our time. His hard work, dedication, and perseverance have earned him a special place in the hearts of millions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Becoming The Comedy Queen: Here's How Kathy Griffin Made Her $35 Million Fortune</a></span></p><h2 id=george-s-start-with-stand-up-comedy>George’s Start With Stand-Up Comedy</h2><p>George Lopez's journey in stand-up comedy was no laughing matter. He started at the bottom, performing at small bars and clubs, honing his craft and waiting for his big break. But despite the challenges, he never gave up. His talent, passion, and unique perspective on life slowly but surely <a href=#>caught the attention of fans</a> and fellow comedians alike. Soon, he was headlining shows across the country and making a name for himself in the cutthroat world of comedy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lopez's comedic style was unlike anything audiences had seen before. His sharp wit and irreverent humor drew fans from all walks of life, and he quickly became known for his hilarious observations on race, family, and everyday life. His success on stage eventually led to a breakthrough on cable television, where he hosted his own comedy show on the cable network, Showtime. From there, he took to some of the biggest stages in the country, including the Just for Laughs comedy festival and <a href=#>the HBO Comedy Festival</a>, cementing his status as one of the most gifted and sought-after comedians of his generation.</p><h2 id=breaking-into-television>Breaking Into Television</h2><p>After he had spent several years in the stand-up comedy circuit George was approached by actress Sandra Bullock, who was equally concerned about the lack of <a href=#>Hispanic-oriented sitcoms</a> on American television. Bullock was instrumental in getting a sitcom that starred Hispanics on television without exclusively being about the Hispanic-American community. The sitcom was quickly picked up by ABC, and in 2002, George Lopez became one of the few Latinos to star in a television comedy series. The show ran for six seasons before it was canceled in 2007.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to his show, Lopez has appeared in several other television programs, including <i>Inside the NFL</i> and <i>Reno 911!</i> In 2013, Lopez starred in his own sitcom, <i>Saint George</i>, which was canceled after one season. However, in 2015, he received another straight-to-series order for <i>Lopez</i>, a semi-autobiographical single-camera sitcom. George has also appeared as a guest judge <a href=#>on</a><a href=#><i> America's Got Talent</i></a>, where he used his golden buzzer to send a dance group called Malevo straight to the live shows. In May 2022, NBC picked up his new series,<i> Lopez vs. Lopez</i>, where he co-stars with his daughter Mayan.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Fergie Story: How Sarah Ferguson Made Her $45 Million Fortune</a></span></p><h2 id=lopez-s-remarkable-stint-in-hollywood>Lopez’s Remarkable Stint In Hollywood</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>George Lopez's journey in Hollywood is remarkable, with his work spanning from film to television.
