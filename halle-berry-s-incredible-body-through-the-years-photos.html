I was a gymnast growing up, and that certainly has helped, as I have always been very athletic.”</p><p>Berry’s drive is part of her winning formula, according to her trainer, <strong>Peter Lee Thomas</strong>. “She’s one of those special individuals who, even if she has one to two hours of sleep, she’ll get work done,” he exclusively told&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;in October 2018. “It will take a lot for her to say, ‘Hey, I can’t train today.’”</p><p>The Emmy winner alternates between yoga, boxing, cardio and weights five days a week. No matter which exercise she does, her goal is always “to make sure we get a really good sweat.”</p><p>Berry also “has a really strong desire to keep her stomach fit,” Thomas told&nbsp;Us. “She definitely loves to train her core, but she also knows the importance of full-body connection and fitness.”</p><p>The&nbsp;X-Men&nbsp;star got real in June 2020 about how her fitness regimen changed as she grew older. “Back in my 20s (and 30s), though, I mostly worked out in order to look a certain way. I was young and appearance was a big part of my early acting career,” she wrote in an article for&nbsp;<a href=#>Women’s Health</a>. “Back then, my workouts focused on weights. I was always in the gym, either sitting at a weight machine or with a barbell in my hands. It was all about&nbsp;sculpting; I worked my butt off isolating muscle groups and lifting as heavy as I could. It was a little boring (I knew every Monday would be exactly the same as the Monday before), but I looked fit and that was enough for me at the time.”</p><p>Berry noted that she “began to see fitness as a way to care for my health and my body” after learning she has diabetes. “I began to focus on&nbsp;feeling&nbsp;fit more than&nbsp;looking&nbsp;fit and my workouts became acts of self-care,” she explained.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Ohio native “wanted to be strong and healthy for my kids” after <a href=#>welcoming daughter Nahla</a> in March 2008 and <a href=#>son Maceo</a> in October 2013. “I wanted to be around for them as long as possible,” she detailed. “I wanted to be able to carry them out of a burning house if I needed to.”</p><p>Scroll down to see Berry’s evolution through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNktaK4y55km52ip8a0ecinmqudlJ6vrbGMm6adsV2ptbO71KCfZqyYmnq6scCrqmZqYGZ%2FeoSO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./here-s-why-angelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt-s-real-estate-portfolio-was-unrivalled-during-their-relation.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Here's Why Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's Real Estate Portfolio Was Unrivalled During Their Relation</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hailee-steinfeld-partners-with-frankies-bikinis-pics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hailee Steinfeld Partners With Frankies Bikinis: Pics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
