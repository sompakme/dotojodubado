Though he never publicly addressed living with the brain disorder, the certificate claims he was diagnosed with it “years” ago.</p><p>News of Barker’s cause of death comes nearly two weeks after he <a href=#>passed away at the age of 99</a> on August 26. The TV legend’s publicist, <strong>Roger Neal</strong>, confirmed to Us Weekly at the time that Barker died in his home of natural causes. He is survived by his half-brother <strong>Kent Valandra</strong>, nephews <strong>Robert</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Chip Valandra</strong> and niece <strong>Vickie Valandra Kelly</strong>.</p><p><strong>Nancy Burnet</strong> — a longtime friend of Barker’s and the coexecutor of his estate — said in a statement that she was “so proud” of the work she and Barker “did together to <a href=#>expose the cruelty to animals</a> in the entertainment industry and including working to improve the plight of abused and exploited animals in the United States and internationally.”</p><p>She ended her message by writing, “We were great friends over these 40 years. He will be missed.”</p><p>Several celebrities also took to social media to express their condolences. <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> paid tribute to Barker’s animal rights advocacy work by writing via his Instagram Story, “It’s a beautiful day to remember to help control the pet population [and] have your pets spayed or neutered. Rest in peace, Bob Barker.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Adam Sandler</strong></a> remembered his late Happy Gilmore costar by <a href=#>sharing pics of them</a> from over the years via <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “The man. The myth. The best,” the comedian, 56, captioned his post. “Such a sweet funny guy to hang out with. Loved talking to him. Loved laughing with him. Loved him kicking the crap out of me. He will be missed by everyone I know! Heartbreaking day. Love to Bob always and his family! Thanks for all you gave us!”</p><p>Barker became a household name as the host of The Price Is Right, which is the longest-running game show of all time in the United States. He began his hosting duties in 1972 and later passed the baton to current host <a href=#><strong>Drew Carey</strong></a> in 2007.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bob-Barkers-Cause-of-Death-Revealed-The-Price-Is-Right-Host-Died-of-Alzheimers-Disease2.jpg><p>“I want to retire while I’m still young,” he told USA Today in 2006 at the age of 82. “I could do the show another year, but I’d rather quit a year too soon than a year too late.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Barker founded the animal rights organization the DJ&T Foundation in 1994, which he named after his mother, Tilly Valandra, and his late wife, Dorothy Jo Gideon. Gideon, who was Barker’s high school sweetheart, died from lung cancer at the age of 91 in 1981.</p><p>In addition to The Price Is Right, Barker also served as the host of NBC’s Truth or Consequences from 1956 to 1974 and appeared in several movies and TV shows over the years. He received a Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999 and was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame and National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2004 and 2007, respectively.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabp5Jir6K%2Byp6prGWTlsK0sYyonWaclZbBqXnRnq2emZyasW6wxK2YoqSjZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./did-taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-s-breakup-alter-her-2023-tour-or-just-set-it-up-for-incredible-succes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn's Breakup Alter Her 2023 Tour Or Just Set It Up For Incredible Succes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./aew-full-gear-four-way-ladder-tag-team-title-match-result.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>AEW Full Gear: Four-Way Ladder Tag Team Title Match Result</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
