"When he got on the stage, his pants were pulled down, exposing his buttocks. Lizzo then began yelling, 'Take it off!' while a club performer hit the security guard with whips."</p><p>The lawsuit further claims that Lizzo was racist towards her employees, as she "treated the Black members of the dance team differently than other members,” and that Lizzo also fat-shamed the dancers, while Quigley shared inappropriate information about her ex life.</p><p><a href=#>Lizzo publicly responded to the lawsuit to deny the claims</a>, and from the sounds of it, she plans to fight the allegations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"With passion comes hard work and high standards," the Yitty founder said in a statement. "Sometimes I have to make hard decisions, but it's never my intention to make anyone feel uncomfortable or like they aren't valued as an important part of the team. I am not here to be looked at as a victim, but I also know that I am not the villain that people and the media have portrayed me to be these last few days.”</p><p>“I am very open with my sexuality and expressing myself, but I cannot accept or allow people to use that openness to make me out to be something I am not,” she continued. “There is nothing I take more seriously than the respect we deserve as women in the world. I know what it feels like to be body-shamed on a daily basis and would absolutely never criticize or terminate an employee because of their weight."</p><p>For now, it’s unclear how much the plaintiffs are seeking in damages. The case remains ongoing.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here’s What Sofia Vergara Is Asking For In Her Million-Dollar Divorce</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>Billboard</a>, <a href=#>TheGuardian</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS5qsbZqGScp6WhsW6ywJycZqWZobmqu82sZKKmXZmurq3GnqpmmZapsrN5wZ6gp59dqMKmsIyfpqtlopawqq3LZqqesKWWuW60wKuYrKudmru1ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./new-the-little-mermaid-trailer-leads-youtube-to-disable-the-dislike-counter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>New The Little Mermaid Trailer Leads YouTube To Disable The Dislike Counter</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./keke-palmer-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Keke Palmer - photos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth-therichest.html>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chloe-grace-moretz-defends-her-tweets-about-kim-kardashian-s-nude-selfie.html>Chloe Grace Moretz Defends Her Tweets About Kim Kardashians Nude Selfie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./everything-we-know-about-zach-efron-s-brother-dylan-and-his-reclusive-personal-life.html>Everything We Know About Zach Efron's Brother Dylan And His Reclusive Personal Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-del-rey-performs-surprise-duet-with-jack-antonoff.html>Lana Del Rey Performs Surprise Duet With Jack Antonoff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./phillip-redmond-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Phillip Redmond Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
