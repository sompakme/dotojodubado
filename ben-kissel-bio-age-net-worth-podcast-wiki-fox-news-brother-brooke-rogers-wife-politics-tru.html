The hosts of “Last Podcast on the Left” do not feel especially vindicated that they were right about an alleged pedophile conspiracy.

But it’s good that the rocks are being overturned and we’re seeing all the bugs,” said co-host Ben Kissel. “No one knows where Jeffrey Epstein’s money comes from. The president has no interest in seeing him going down,” co-host Henry Zebrowski added.</p><p>For nearly ten years, Kissel, Zebrowski, and Marcus Parks, who are all in their mid-thirties, have secured conspiracy-theory culture on their show. A pioneer of true-crime and horror-comedy podcasting.
