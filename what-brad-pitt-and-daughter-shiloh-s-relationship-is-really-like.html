The couple were legally married on August 14, 2014, in Los Angeles. They had a private wedding ceremony in Château Miraval, France, on August 23, 2014. But on September 19, 2016, Jolie shocked the world after <a href=#>filing for divorce from Pitt,</a> citing irreconcilable differences. They are parents to <a href=#>six children</a>: Maddox, 21, Pax, 18, Zahara, 17, Shiloh, 16, and 14-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.Sources close to Pitt have suggested that Jolie has been "poisoning" their kids against their father. The insider close to the Bullet Train star came to his defense after Jolie claimed that he “choked one of their children and struck another in the face” during an incident on a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> private plane.</a> In September 2016, the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services investigated Pitt for child abuse. He was accused of being "verbally abusive" and "physical" towards one of his children. The Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services eventually ruled that Pitt did not physically abuse any of his children. Pitt was also cleared by the FBI of any wrongdoing.A source close to Pitt told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> that Pitt has a "limited and strained relationship” with his six children because of Jolie's "smear campaign" against him. The actor’s source alleged that Jolie has “poisoned” the kids against their dad to the point that he has little to no relationship with them. "Maddox, Pax and Zahara don’t really see both sides of the picture," another insider told OK! Magazine. "They’re Team Angelina.”However, the Jolie and Pitt's firstborn daughter Shiloh does not agree with her elder siblings. The source claims she has been trying to "encourage” them “to have a relationship with their dad.” But where does Shiloh's relationship with her father stand?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shiloh-jolie-pitt-had-a-small-role-in-the-curious-case-of-benjamin-button>Shiloh Jolie Pitt Had A Small Role In 'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button'</h2><p>Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt is Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's first biological daughter. To avoid the massive press scrutiny, the then couple traveled to Namibia for Jolie to give birth. Shiloh had her first taste of fame after Jolie and Pitt sold the first pictures of her to distributor Getty Images. The aim was for the money to go to charity, rather than allowing paparazzi to take the photographs. People and Hello! magazines purchased the North American and British rights to the images for $4.1 and $3.5 million, respectively. At the time it was a record in celebrity photojournalism. All proceeds donated to UNICEF.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shiloh and her father grew a strong bond, so much so that when she was two, Pitt took his daughter on set with him. Baby Shiloh has a small part in the Oscar-winning film <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</a>. The 2008 movie is about a man (Benjamin Button, played in part by Brad Pitt) who ages backward.</p><h2 id=shiloh-jolie-pitt-went-viral-for-her-dance-moves>Shiloh-Jolie Pitt Went Viral For Her Dance Moves</h2><p>Shiloh-Jolie Pitt recently went viral after performing slick choreography to Doja Cat’s latest song, “Vegas,” from the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis.

In the video, Jolie-Pitt wears an all-black ensemble including black sweatpants and a black Beatles band T-shirt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An “insider” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told US Weekly</a> that Angelina and Brad—who are in a bitter <a href=#>legal battle</a> years after their divorce—are “very proud” of their daughter’s recent success as a dancer. “They’d have no issue if she wants to turn pro, but they’re not pushing it on her by any means,” the insider said. The source revealed that Shiloh has a very close relationship with both her parents who both give her career advice.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Shiloh Jolie-Pitt And Gavin Rossdale's Son Kingston?</a></span></p><h2 id=brad-pitt-revealed-his-daughter-s-dance-moves-brought-a-tear-to-his-eye>Brad Pitt Revealed His Daughter's Dance Moves Brought A 'Tear To His Eye'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brad Pitt couldn't help but gush over his 16-year-old daughter Shiloh dance skills while walking the red carpet at the Bullet Train premiere at the Regency Village Theater in Los Angeles. “It brings a tear to the eye,” the actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told Entertainment Tonight</a>. When asked about the viral video of his daughter dancing to Doja Cat’s “Vegas,” he called his daughter “very beautiful.” Pitt, 58, also joked about not knowing where Shiloh got her moves from, as he admitted he does not have the sharpest dance skills.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Purposely Pick A Distant College To Stay Away From Mom Angelina?</a></span></p><p>“I don’t know where she got it from.
